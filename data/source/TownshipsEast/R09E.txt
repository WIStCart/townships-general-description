The Surface of this Township is
generally rolling.  The Soil of only a

and in other parts it is Scattering
 It is pretty well Settled in all parts of

T16NR9E
	This township, like that East of it
	in Range 10 is favorably Situated
	for communication with the Fox River
	Valley, and with places around it; for 
though abounding in marshes and swamps,
the dry ground is yet continuous in those
directions where roads are needed. A dry road,
scarcely interrupted by a single slough or
marsh, runs through its whole extent from 
North West to South east, leading in the one
direction to Montello at the East end of Buf=
falo Lake, and in the other, towards the great
Wisconsin Pinery, whose best known villages
are Stevens Point and Plover Portage.
	Unlike Several of the townships in the 
vicinity, this township does not contain within
its limits any considerable Lake. The Mon=
tello Creek, always pursuing  devious, ser=
-pentine course, skirts its northern boundary,
and from near a central point between the

East and West extremities of the North
Town line, takes a direction towards the South
East corner of the Township. And wherever
this stream flows, may be found pure Sweet
water, running in a Swift, copious tide, and 
rich bottom lands for meadow, subject however,
to occasioned inundation, and a variety of
excellent timber. Two of the mill-privileges
afforded by this stream are already occupied by
saw-mills; and there are other mill-sites
along this river and Duck Creek, which are
not like to be soon occupied, nor needed by
the present sparse population. But the pop-
=ulation will not probably remain this sparse
for a great lenth of time. There is not a little
good land within the borders of this township,
which is not yet brought under cultivation. One 
excellent quality of the Soil is its warmth; the silice=
=ous element of which glows under the early sun=
=shine of Summer, and compensates for the high
northern Situation of this region of Country, by
the forwardness with which all Kinds of grain
grass, roots & melons are   . Probably

no part of the Menominee tract will ever be
capable of Sustaining a dense population, as
compared with those parts of wisconsin lying
South of the Fox River; but there is abundant
room for more imigrants than have yet come
to seek homes here, and cultivate these acres
 And whatever the Soil shall prove itself to be
under the hand of continued cultivation, there
will at least be found here & doubtless through
all coming time, a temporate and beautiful
climate.  And if the settlers can maintain
the lands they claim in any thing like their
present fertility, they need not look farther 
for the amplish rewards of their industry.-

T17NR9E
   General Description-
	This Township is traversed from North
West to South East by a Road, leading from
Montello on the Fox River to the Great Wisconsin 
Pinery; from which, near the North Town line
diverges a road leading to Dacotah, a new vil=
=lage near the S.W. corner of Town 18. Range 10;
at which, a flowing-mill has recently been
built, and is now in Successful operation.
     The streams of water pervading into this Township
of chief importance are Bachelor's Creek, flow=
=ing from the North West corner of the township
into Montello Creek, near the South East
part, and Alder Creek. The last named, 
runs in two branches through about half of the
Sections in the two northern tiers, and falls into
the Makan, in the Township next East.
This township is very thinly settled, the entire num=
ber of inhabited houses, as yet, not exceeding a
dozen. A few unmarried young men, boarding 
together at the same house gave name to the

Creek already described along which their claims
or improvements were located. Nor is the land
of a character ever to sustain a large population,
much of it being of so poor a soil as not to
be worth cultivation. And as is the soil, so is the
timber, thin and of little value. The best tim=
=ber is to be found on the bottom lands of Mon=
=tello Creek. A large proportion of the township,-
certainly more than one half, is marsh;-much
of it too wet and too soft to be used as hay
marsh, and incapable from its situation of
being drained. Nearly the whole of the three
Eastern tiers of sections, leaving out the tier border=
=ing on the Town line, North and South, is marsh.
Plenty of stone may be found in Some of the
hills; and water-power is to be had along
Bachelor's Creek,- more than is soon like to be
used.-

Township 18 North
Range 9 East of 4th Principal Meridian
 This Township is a good part 
of it rolling in Surface, and in
some few places to hilly for cul-
-tivation.  The Soil is rather thin
and rests on a Subsoil of 
Sand,  which So far prepon-
-derates in some of the most 
hilly portion, as to render 
the Soil to all appearances un-
-productive.  Some of the Creek
bottoms however, as well as the
lands near them are of good
quality.  Mechan River enters
the Township in the North
-west part of it, and pursues
a Southeast Course, until it
crosses the east boundary in
Section 36.  Several Small
streams of excellent water 
head in this Township

or run through it.  Timber
is Scarce, although the oak
openings and Creek bottoms
furnish plenty of wood for
ordinary purposes.  There
are quite a number of Settlers
located along the Mechan,
but the remainder is yet in
its primitive state unclaimed
by man.

through the whole length of it in a North easterly
direction, which are covered with a Scrubby
growth of Black oak brush, and are to all
appearance perfectly barren. illegible the
whole of the Township, with the exception of
a few places is too Sandy & barren for
Cultivation.  The timber is Scattering &

Lakes, in the Northern part of it, and 
which extend nearly in an East & West

      General Description.
	There are two lumbering
establishments in this Township-vis.
Parker's, in the Southwest part of Section 5,
and Brown's in the north and middle part
of section 18; but much of the valuable pine
timber near the course of the Plover has already been
cut off. McGregor's Saw mill is in the township
southwest of this. The river Plover is a shallow
stream, but at the season of its flood serves to
float logs down to the mills below. It enters
the township near the N.W. corner, and running
a southerly course leaves it near the southwest
corner.  There may be found millsites in the
township along this stream, though, in general,

	General Description
the banks are too low to form a good head.
There would be no deficiency of water at any
season of the year. The Plover is the only river of a
note; but some of the Sources of the Waupaca are
be found in Sections 35 and 36. Some of the head
waters of the Little Wolf are also met with in the eastern
part of the Township.
This Township contains Some extensive cedar
and Tamarac Swamps, and Spruce and tamarac marsh
=es. In the latter division, the spruce trees are seldom
more than 10 or 15 feet high, nor more than 3 inches
diameter. The open marshes are small and not
numerous. The best fine timber is to be found along
the N.E. quarter of the township and the three sections
immediately South of that tract; and the westward illegible
the first and second tiers of sections on the north Side
the township.
	The Surface of this township is more level
in the central and northern than in the Southern part
	Between the first tier of sections both illegible
	the southeast and southwest sides of the
township, a belt of land embracing about four
sections from East to West, and two sections
wide is almost entirely denuded of trees.
This belt consists of bushy Knobs and ridges,
generally however with a poor soil, and without
streams of water. What rocks there are in the 
tract are of coarse granite.-

T26NR9E
	General Description
There are several tracts of valuable lumbering pine
timber in this Township; the principal of which

	General Description
are in the Western part, and are already being cut
upon, and run down the Plover river. Tamarac
and cedar swamps are numerous and extensive
especially in the Eastern part of the Township, all of
them utterly unfit for cultivation & worthless except
for their timber, should they ever become acessible
by means of roads, to the population south.
    The Surface is generally level; and the quality of the
upland soil seldom rises above second rate; often it
falls below.-   Nearly the whole surface of the
=Township is thickly timbered, the growth being pine,
hemlock, tamarac, cedar, birch, maple, lind, poplar and
ironwood.
	There is but little open marsh, and scarcely
anything that can be called prairie.
	There are three lakes of Considerable size,
situated    one in Sectons 11 and 12; another in
sections 17 and 20; and a third, Considerably Smaller
in Sections 32 and 33. besides several Smaller ones.
Big Plover, which enters the Township in Section 3,
running a Southwesterly course, leaves it in Section
31.-   It is a shallow stream with a brisk current
and can only be used for driving lumber when it is at
its flood, in the early spring months.
	Good mill sites might undoubtedly be found
upon it, especially in the northern sectons of its course
	There is one lumbering establishment located
upon Section 16 ( Merrill and Bowdem''s ); another
Howard's on Section 33.  These are the only
habitations of white men noticed in the township.
at neither of which has the cultivation of the soil
as yet been attempted: nor, if it were, would the
returns from the soil reward the trouble.-
