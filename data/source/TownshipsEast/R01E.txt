T1NR1E
	T1N._R1E.(N.W.Terry.)
	General Remarks
	The township,to which the forgo=
ing notes relate, embraces a portion of
country among some of the earliest
settlements in the Mining district, and 
in the hope of finding lead ore al=
most every part of the township has at
different times, been tried by the
miners. Most of the diggings, however,
are now abandoned, except those in
sections 23. 24. 25 and 26 which still 
afford profitable employment to the
persons engaged in them.
	The population of the township
is mostly located along the "West Fork

	T1N,_R1E. (N.W.Terry.)
of Fever River", running through it
and is now rather of an agricultural
than a mining character. The principle 
settlements are at Buncomb, Natchez, and
Murphy's Mill, at each of which place, 
there are about six or eight families.
	The mill, at the last mentioned place
is a grist mill, with two runs of stones;
and occupies a site which is one of the
best in the western States; and was made
by cutting and blasting the rocks to con
=siderable depth through a ridge about
two chains wide, so as to allow the
water of the river to pass and to give
it a fall of about twenty feet. The 
site is on the east half of the N.W. 1/4
of Section 15.

	T1N._R1E. (N.W.Terry.)
	The surface of the land in this
township is generally rolling, and along
the river in some places hilly. The soil
is mostly of good quality, and some 
parts of the township are thinly covered 
with small trees and bushes of oak. The
remainder is prairie.
	To mark the places of the sectional
and 1/4 Section corners on the prairie, mounds
of earth are raised agreeably to instructions,
and that they may be more easily distin=
guished, those at the section corners are
made in the form of a frustum of a 
4 sided pyramid, and those at the 1/4 section
corners in the form of a frustum of
a cone.
	Where trees are marked for Corners,

	T1N_R1E. (N.W. Terry.)
they, with their diameters, bearings and
distances, are noted immediately after
the note of the respective posts, and are
marked in the book with a brace
as may be seen by reference to the
notes of the line between Sections 35
and 36, page 1.

T2NR1E
	General Remarks
	The afore described township
is about half prairie and half
open wood land, timbered with
white, black and bur Oak-The 
surface is rolling, and about
two thirds of the township is 1st
rate land.
	Elk Grove, in the N.W. corner of
this township, is a beautiful, pleas=
ant place and is the residence of 
three or four families and has
a post office- Several families 
also live along down Fever River.
The inhabitants support themselves
chiefly by farming; very little

is done at mining, and it is
not known that any ore exists
in any considerable quantity 
within the limits of the township.

T3NR1E
	General Remarks
	The township described in the
foregoing field notes, is nearly all
high, dry, rolling and 1st. rate
prairie, and affords much land
that is valuable for farming purpo=
ses- There is little or no mining carried
on within its borders, and it is supposed
not to contain lead ore in much quantity.
	The mounds on its northern boun=
dary are a natural curiosity and well
worth remarking- They seem orinally to have
been of calcareaus sand rock, but time has round=
ded them off and they are now covered with 
a thin stratum of earth. Their height from the
base is about 150 feet and from their tops there
us a fine view of the whole country around-
