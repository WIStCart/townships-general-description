       The aggregate quality of Soil
of this Township is perhaps a Shadow
better than 2d rate - It is tolerable
well watered by the "Catfish" & 4 Small
tributaries 2 on either side
    A narrow skirt of Prairie is divided
from the Catfish by a illegible skirt
of good timber as will be seen by
the Diagram.
     A good dry Rolling Prairie extends
from the N.W. quarter of the Town
far to the north  the Soil of which is 
dark Sandy loam
       The Catfish upon outlet of 
The Four Lakes meanders pleasantly 
thru the Township - abounds in fine
Fish & water fowl  Especially Wild geese
with which we took some liberties &c

T6NR11E
	Remarks
	This Township tho divided
by its share of crooked marshes may
be ranked as good 2d rate land
      The Soil generally a warm light
Sandy loam which will richly repay
the cultivator
      It may be said to be well watered
by the narrow marshes in which is 
running water in some illegible
into brooks but mostly expanded in
the marsh
	The foot & Outlet of the 
First Lake on Sec. 19.30. &c a beautiful
Sheet of pure water abounding in Excel-
-lent Fish & great variety of water fowl
offer fine inducements to the sports man
	The Catfish illegible at a moderate
Expense in deeponing the channel
may become (and undoubtedly will)
navigable for Steam boats from
Rock River to this lake a distance
by its meandering of about 20 miles

	General Remarks
 The South East & North & North East
part of this Township is rolling prairie
& first rate land from the N E to the
South West part of the Township there
is a line or chain of Marshes that lies so low
& flat that cannot be drained so is to be
of any use. The ridges of dry land between 
the marshes are thinly timbered with 
White Oak Black Oak & Bur Oak,
poor 2nd rate land. Soil sand.
 The streams are deep & muddy bottom
Current dull.& Sluggish There are
no Springs excep those that rise up in
the marshes. This Township might
be called 2nd rate.

   General Discription
 This Township is level or gently

addapted to farming purposes
The timber is of a medium qual-
=ity consisting of White Black and
Bur Oak.  The Mechan River
comes into the Township in
Section 7 and goes out in Section

enterprising population and con-

East Side of Fox River

T17NR11E
	General Remarks
 The proportion of marsh and swamp in this Township
to that of dry land is large,- probably, one half or more;
and the dry land is very dry, & the marsh, much of it, very
wet. Still there is not a little good land, & a few good farms
commenced ; though the states of agricultural improvement is, on
account of its recent settlement, very low. Brush fences,hay-cov-
=ered barns & stables, where there are barns or stables at all, and the
rudish log houses or board Shanties are the Structures commonly
met with. The face of the country is generally level, there are two or
three stone hills of note, & the township is traversed from N.W to S.E
by the White river, a valuable mill stream of clear sweet water. There is
no lake of much importance; Dakins's Pond, in the N.W. corner of the town
when the dam is completed will flood a large tract of country  This place will
drive a grist-mill, the only mill as yet built in the Township.-

T18NR11E
Town 18 North, Range 11 East,4th Meridian
This Township differs from several of the Town=
=ships around it, in being more free from
marshes, and in having several large and
handsome lakes.  The face of the Country
in the east side is level and open, towards
the Fox River; on the west side, it is hilly.
	The climate is healthful, and much
of the soil good. But it is not a soil 
that will endure a succession of exhausting
crops. It is a warm, willing soil, but one
that will need moderation in corn and
wheat-cropping, and care and skill in
husbanding its natural resources, in order 
to make it permanently useful to the agricul=
=turist. And this remark is especially applica=
=ble to the whole of this Indian tract of coun=
=try; that is, the cultivable portions of it. In the
town now under condideration, there is a deficien=
=cy in streams of living water, Spring Lake being
almost the only condiderable body of water,

Town 18 North, Range 11 East, 4th Meridian
that has an outlet. White River passes
through two or three of the South west Sections
of this township, and Willow Creek through the
N.E part, increases as this land is near its
bend to the East by a small brook which is the
natural outlet to Menominee John's Lake,
situated in the township next north, and which 
runs an easterly course through four or five
of the sections in the north tier. The land
about Spring Lake, in the S.E. part of the
Township abounds in springs of pure sweet
water; but the character of the surface around
it is such as to render it dangerous of approach
to cattle and horses, as also are some of the
marshes north east illegible. It is supposed that
the other lakes in this township are sustained
by subterraneous springs, since there is no
traceable inlet; and yet, evaporation, taking
one year with another, does not diminish
the quantity of water contained in them.

Some of these lakes seem to be subject to a pe=
=riodical retrocepion of their waters. I have had
occasion to remark in the course of the present
autumn, between the first of September and
November a Subsidence in waters of Hill's
Lake, to the mount of at least 2 ft. in per=
pendicular height. Within the past year, a 
narrow ditch has been cut from the South side
of Fish Lake to the north margin of Wolf Lake,
at a point where the two lakes approach each other 
within 1 1/2 chains, since which, there has been a
constant flow of water from Fish into Wolf Lake,
without as yet affecting an equilibrium. Both
are large lakes and deep in the middle,
but shallow in most places near the shore; &
contain a variety of Fish. This township is
fast recieving accessions to its population by im=
=migration, and the settlers are of an industrious
and enterprising class. In this township there is
no grist-mill as yet, but there is one being now
built,(Dakin's) near the South west corner, on 
White River, in the town next south. There is 
one saw-mill on Willow Creek in the N.E. 

Section; Shumway's mill, which has made a 
great deal of pine lumber is situated in the
Township next west.- There is a valuable
quarry of granite in the East half of the south=
-west quarter of section 27. In short, this
Township is decidedly better than the average
of those townships in the Indian country
which I have either surveyed or
seen; and many good claims, of am=
=ple dimensions for farming, may yet
be made within its limits.

but a considerable portion
is unfit for Cultivation,
owing to the numerous 
Marshes & Swamps, through 
it.  There are numerous Lakes

through it in a Southeasterly
direction, the Bottoms to
which are very wide, and 
swampy.  The timber is 
of a good quality, consisting
of White, Black & Bur Oak
Black & White Ash, Tamarac,
with considerable Pine, on
the River.  There are about
8 or 10 Settlers in it at

present but claims are daily
being made.  Besides Pine

T25NR11E
	General Description
  This townsip consists principally of heavily
timbered land, to the entire exclusion of
prairie. Amongst the many valuable Kinds of
timber it contains, ought to be mentioned the Norway
and white pine, the sugar maple and the ceder.
There is also to be found the Smooth-bark hickory,
To valuable for axe handles and the Like uses, and
which is so rare in many sections of the country. 
The township contains several cedar and tamarac
swamps, some of which are of considerable extent,
and valuable only as rail & post timber.
The surface is generally uneven; a fair proportion
is upland woods, much encumbered, however,

with masses of stone, a coarse species of granite
but scantily supplied with good Soil or mould.
Of first rate land, there is very little, except along
Little Wolf bottoms and in the western tier of Sections
Openings are not to be found here, and the heavily
timbered surface is yet more obstructed to the eye
by the rank undergrowth of bushes and young sap-
-lings; and the windfalls and deadened poplar
tracts are filled up with brambles. The marshes are
but few, and of quite limited extent. The Little
Wolf, a Shallow rapid Stream, recieves an important
tributary from the N.E. and another from the
            S.W. part of this Township. Illegible
Creek that is intermediate between those two, illegible
flowing in from the N.W. seems to be the principle
stream, and the others       its tributaries; illegible
illegible whose banks, and the want of natural em-
bankments for the formation of a good head, offers illegible
only obstacle to a good motive power for mills and
machinery. There are no horses, no bridges, no roads,
no improvements of any kind. 

T26NR11E
General Description of Township No
 This Township is singularly
destitute of lakes and open 
marshes, nor does it abound in
streams of running water; and
there is only one creek of any im=
=portance running through the town=
=ship.  But the swamps, especially
cedar swamps, are numerous, one of 
which near the middle of the town
is very large. They are all unfit for
cultivation; nor does the writer remem
-ber to have seen any hay marsh along
the creek.  It may be confidently as=
=serted that there are not more than
6 or 7 Section lines in the whole town
=ship, which do not intersect at least
one swamp, and generally they intersect
several, either of spruce, alder, cedar or
tamarac.
   the surface, out of swamps, is

26 North, Range 11 East, 4th meridian,
generally rolling ; and here the quality
of the soil varies from first rate to
second rate.   A considerabe part
of the land is stony; and there is
scarcely an acre of dry ground, in
the entire township, that can be
classed with prairie or openings-
the whole is densely covered with a
forest growth. The timber on the up=
=land portion of the township is chiefly
hemlock, maple, birch, elm, lind and
poplar; in the swamps, cedar, tamarac,
and black ash. The poportion of
hickory, oak & ironwood is smaller. A
creek enters the township from the N.
W. in section 18, crossing the line
between Ranges 10 and 11, and run=
=ning in a S.E. course leaves the 
township in section 34, crossing the
line between townships 25 and 26. 

General Description of Township No
but its course is not generally rapid
and no mill-site was noticed 
along the course of our lines.
No traces of any mineral or
metal of value were observed, &
no mineral spring.
    There is no improvement within
the township, and no habitation 
except a few huts of some nomadic
families of Indians in the Eastern
part of the township, who from time to
time encamp near a small lake
or pond in section 26, for the
purpose either of fishing, or hunting,
or making maple sugar.
