T1NR2E
	  General Remarks
	The afore described township, em-
bracing as it does, some of the oldest
wrought and richest mines in the
country, is generally rolling, 1st. rate
land, about half prairie and half
thinly timbered with oak, with 
undergrowth of hazel. Within its
limits are three different settlements
or towns, viz - "Shulls burg" in sections
3 & 10, "Gratiots Grove" in Sections 22
and 23, and "White Oak Spring" in 
Section 32. each of which settlements
now contains about five or six
families, but the two former, in the
most prosperous days of the 
mining business, have heretofore at

one time, contained not less than
forty families each-
	Besides these settlements, there
are several farm es located in dif.
ferent parts of the township -
	The mines which have heretofore
been very productive, are situated
principally on sections 2, 3, 10,
11 and 14, but are now nearly 
abandoned as they are thought 
to be not worth working.

T2NR2E
	Remarks
 The township to which the
foregoing notes relate is nearly
all high, dry, rolling, first
=rate prairie - There are 
scarce any diggings, and
little or no timber to be
found except on the west
side of the township -
     The mounds at the section
corners are 3 feet square at base
& 2 1/2 feet high-  And at
the quarter Section Corners
they are 3 feet in diameter
at base ( which is circular )
and 2 1/2 feet high -

T3NR2E
	General Remarks
 The South west part of the
afore described township is nearly
all 1st. rate prairie, surface
rolling.  The north east part is hilly
and mostly 2'.. rate land, covered
with a scattering growth of
white, and bur Oak-
 There are several excellent
farms, but no mines in the 
township -

This Township lies in the "Divide "
between the Baraboo & Pine Rivers
& is for the greater part heavily timbered
the timber being of good quality,- large 
and thrifty.  The land is principally
undulating; of good quality,- well adapted
to farming purposes;- The principal 
objection being, a want of water;- though
this where it is found, is of superior
quality. Nothing else was observed, worthy
of remark.

	General Description
This Township is uniform in features,
- flat, low, wet - There is not
enough of good cultivable land to
be found in it laying together, to
make a forty acre lot - the 
soil is yellow sand & the subsoil
appears to be a kind of quicksand.
The water appears to be generally
as high as at present, there are
many marks made by the water that
show conclusively that it is freequent
-ly much higher than at present:
One of the prominent features of these
swamps is the great depth of the 
streams & rivers, they are generally
of depth equal to 1/4 of their width,
the color of the water is a deep
(vegetable) brown - something near the
color of coffee -  The timber is
Nearly or quite worthless-
