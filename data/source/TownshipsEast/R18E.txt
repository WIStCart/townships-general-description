Note The Lake to which this note refers
could not be approached on 
the N W. side at the time we
were there  and I am very certain
could never be meandered except
on the ice - the marsh for
from 2000 to 50.00 from the Lake
is of the very worst description _ the 
turf or sod floats and rises
with the water in the lake - in 
passing over it   it sank with
our weight from one to three feet
and near the lake where the Musk
=rats have cut it - it is entirely
unpassable -  The diagram
shows the shape of the lake as
near as it could be ascertained
by the eye -

The most of the Prairie
in this township is too
wet- it will make fine
Meadow land, however, when
drained and cultivated.
It is deficient in good
timber for fencing &c
 There is, perhaps a Sufficient
quantity for fire wood-
it is mostly low and
scrubby.
     It is well watered
--some running to 
the east and some to the 
west. Here the great
Indian trail from Mill-
wakee and the road for
Green Bay intersect-and
here, in after times, another
great road from the Mouth
of Shebowaegan will
intersect. Its vicinity to
the Lake will entitle it 
to consideration.

As a whole, it is better
calculated for grass than
grain.

T16NR18E
   This township is 
handsomely situated on
the eastern shore of Lake
Winnebago. It is a good 
township of Land as to soil
and its surface gently undulating.
The Limestone ridge runs
thro' it and appears to have
been the former barrier of 
the Lake. The fall from
the top of the Lime stone Ledge
or upper level to the ground
below and nearly on a level
with the lake varies from
20 to 50 or 60 feet. This 
Ledge stretches from the
North East and probably

preserves its parallelism
with the Lake to near
its outlet (the Fox River)
to the south and west of 
this township it becomes
circular, winding to the
west and apparently turns
the southern extremity
of the Lake. If the Ledge
continue around the 
Lake to near the entrance
of Fox River, the inferense
is not unreasonable (perhaps)
that the Lake rests in a
bason of the Rock and 
formerly extended up
to the ledge. From the 
features of the country
within my limited 
observation, I am led to
conjecture that it is this
same ledge of Lime rock

that ranges the direction
of the Wisconsin and fox Rivers
at the portage and is the 
southern and eastern barrier
to the latter Rides to its
inlet into the Winnebago lake
thense winding round the 
lake it again gives direction
to the River toward green-
Bay. As this is but conjecture,
perhaps, these remarks had 
been better omitted.
 Under the Ledge, there is
very fine timber and a
soil as rich as any other
in this country. On the 
upper level, the timber is 
soomewhat deficient in
quantity and growth.
Some of the prairie is rather
wet, but will make fine
Meadow. From the com-
manding prospect from

the upper level, the lake
stretching as far to the north 
as the eye can reach and to
the west from 6 to 10 miles.
There are but few places
that can compete with this 
for beauty of situation.
 It will probably be a
healthy location.

	This Fraction must be consid
ered as 1st rate. and valuable land.
It consists almost wholly of extensive
(oak) openings & dry & wet Prairies-
the soil is at least 1st rate-a mix
ture of red loam & black Sand.
 Its position (E.side & above the 
center of Winnebago Lake) gives it
an additional value.- The
Stream entering at "Pipe Village",
though Small, & illegible at the
mouth, is nevertheless large enough
for a harbor for boats; and a
small Pier at the mouth would
 deepen the water so that it
might be entered. The banks are
    high & beautiful; and "Pipe Vil
lage" is a beautiful site.

 This Township is 
rather Swampy. The
Eastern half of it

-ing land and there
is some good Pine timber 
scattered over the entire

This Township is Nearly
all embraced in one
large Tamarac & Cedar
Swamp and is of 
but little value

 Nearly the whole

a dense cedar swamp
which is almost
worthless. The re-
mainder of the Town-

poor

T32NR18E
Range 18 East of 4th Prin. Mer.
 In consequence of 
the density of the
timber I have deemed
it advisable to so
correct the N.& S.
lines as to close the 
East randoms at
eighty chains.
The soil of this 
Township is poor
but there is a large
quantity of good pine
timber scattering
over nearly the whole
tract which renders
it valuable

This township is swampy
and poor, tho there is 
good timber along the 
 Peshtigo River & its
tributaries on account
of which it will be readily
purchased as soon as it
may be offered for sale

 The character of 
the country is such
that I have so

 There is a considerable
good Pine timber
along the streams
in this Township
and the soil is 
middling good.
The surface is gently

are large tracts that
