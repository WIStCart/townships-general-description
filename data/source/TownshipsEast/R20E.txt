In making the foregoing survey I
first very carefully run 2 1/2 miles on
the East boundary in order to find the
true bearing which I found to be
5.30 to the left. and I run 1/2 mile
on the south Boundary of the Township
where I found to be 7.08
In all of my lines I confined myself
to those bearings
In Sections 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,16,17,18,19,
and 20 I found many small clefts of 
lime Stone - In the other part of the
Township I found but little Stone
This Township is generally Rolling but
nothing like mountains or high hills
       Timber is good with the various
kinds favourably intermixed
 The ground being covered with snow
during the survey I cannot discern
the quality of the soil. But by every
appearance the groth of Timber and 
face ot the Country induces me to
say the soil is good second rate.

Character history &c of the 
reported Sheboyagan Lakie
    I can say but little concern
ing the history of this part of illegible
-tion. In accordance with spe
cified Instructions I spent three
entire days in examining the 
margin, and going directly
through the reported Lake: in
order to ascertain and determine
whether "an island " existed
therein. The inhabitants resi
dent in the neighborhood,(there
are several families) assured me
there was an island. I took one 
of them, a Mr. Odell, with me:
he pointed out a piece of 
high ground, of some hundred
acres, in Section 25. This tract,
being surrounded by swamp,
illegible a illegible of the illegible Marsh,
is called "the island". This tract

is well within the so called Lake;
Section 25 having been sur
veyed by Mr King, and not ac
turned with official Plot as
any part of the Lake.
	 I found, after care
=ful examination, no insur
mountable, nor common ob
=stacle to a continuous survey,
except the Pond, in Section 14,23
& 24. A man may walk
over any part of this Marsh,(Lake
at any season of the year,(unless
it be just when the ice
is making a leaving) though in 
what is called high water, we
would be in illegible, by walking
perhaps midleg deep.
		No important
    percievable changes

have been affected by illegible
within the last 15 years, nor indeed
for a much longer period.-
Evidences are abundant to the eye,
that the generaly, relative illegible
of water and earth, are about 
the same they were at the date of the 
afforsaid  survey. A sufficient
reason for its having been left as
it was, in the month of April, is 
referable to the fact doubtless, that
at that moment, the ice was just
breaking up, rendering the Pond, river 
as well as the marsh   inpassable.
	The observor, at first would
say "it has at some former period
all been a Lake". But if indeed
it ever was so, it must have
been at some very remote, for
=mer period. It is all one illegible

tract; a rise of water on one part
is equally so on the whole: the tam
erack timber though small, is old
at least 70 to 100 years.
		The mud on this marsh,
under the bog , is several feet deep,
without hard bottom: the lower deposit is of
a fine whitish earth, without sand or
grit resembling starch, to a depth
of 10 feet or more: in fact, we did
not with a 15 foot pole find hard 
bottom. 
	The margin of the marsh 
and swamp is of a uniform char
=acter, Cedar at the edge near the hard
land, say for 3 or 4 chains, there tamer-
ack of a common size, which are
smaller as we go toward the 
open Marsh, till they are not more
than 4 feet high.  The Marsh

has a short Coarse grass, some
times cut by the settlers for hay tho
of a poor quality:- the surrounding
hard land, is excedingly rich
fertile & Beautiful; especially
on the south side. On the N.
and W. it  is somewhat stony 
and uneven.
	The Sheboyagan Rover is
a fine stream, 2 chs wide, 14
feet deep, of a gentle current per
fectly navigable for Boats, the whole
width of the township except where
it passes through the Pond: in this
the navigation would be interrupted
by the "floating island", which covers
the N 1/2 of the Pond, and at both
the inlet and outlet of the River.
This Marsh extending East
=ward & near the Range line,

About 5 chains West of the range
line,     commences a 
slight rapid, once a loose,pebly
bottom, which continues for a 1/2
mile:  This rapid might be
cut down;-illegible some 4 or 5
feet, at a slight expense, by 
illegible means the Marsh illegible

 The soil of this Township, is

stone are illegible seen in the Sur

 East of the River however, is some
Pine timber-where the soil is 2d rate
west of the River, the soil is better;
mostly 1st rate, especially near the
   Risine-  The stream is without
much current, and is environd by
a deep marsh of willow, grass, &
small Tamarack.- It over
flows its banks, in spring, rising
apparently to a great height.- say
5 or 6 feet.

 This Township is situate on

the best, especially for overshot mills-
