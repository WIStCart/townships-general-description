This is a fine township.
The prairie and wood-land
are good and deserving the attention
of the farmer. The Merchant 
and Mechanick will soon
find it for their interest
to vest capital here- Its
location is illegible (at the 
Font du Lac the head of the
Lake) it cannot fail of 
becoming a place of consid-
erable business. It commands
a handsome view of the
Lake- And abounds in
streams of Water sufficiently
large and rapid to drive mills
along the shore there are
evidences of Indian hab-
itations. From the fertility
of the soil and abundant
supply of fish in the Lake

and streams, it is presumed
this has been a favorite
residence of theirs. In short-
from the location of the 
Green-Bar and Portage
road and the probable loca-
tion of other important
Ones leading to and thro' it,
its future prosperity is 
rendered almost certain.
Along and near the margin
of the Lake, however,there
is some Marsh-but
it is not without dry and
solid ground for buildings.
