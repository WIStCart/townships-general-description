Township 14 North, Range 5 East 4th Meridian
 The surface of this Town-
ship is gently undulating,
except in the South - Western
fraction , where it becomes
more uneven and rugged
and is broken into steep and
precipitous hills, rising in
many instances hundreds of
feet above the level of 
the surrounding Country.
 This hilly region constitutes
a fraction of the Divide ,
extending from the Wisconsin
river, beyond the Meridian
and Separating the waters
of the Lemonwier on the
one hand from those of 
Baraboo on the other.
 The hills are rocky and

Township 14 North, Range 5 East 4th Meridian
barren and produce only
a small and inferior growth
of timber, but the narrow
valleys intervening are rich 
and valuable.
     Throughout the Township 
the Soil is generally sandy,
though there are many
localities where it is 
deep and rich - consisting
of mud upon a bed of
clay - well adapted to 
agricultural purposes. This
is especially the case in
the North Western & Southern
parts , in which vicinities
Some thirty claims are
now being taken of & im -
proved.
       The Settlers are an

Township 14 North, Range 5 East 4th Meridian
intelligent  and enterprising
class of people : and
though few of them can date
their residences in the Coun-
try more than a twelve-
month back, they  are
already fast gathering
around them the comforts 
of older Settlements, and
their log houses  and plank
sheds are beginning to
give place  to  more
spacious  and substantial
dwellings.
         This Township is
generally  well watered:
and on the borders of the
streams running through
the Northern tier of
Sections there is an ex-

Township 14 North, Range 5 East 4th Meridian
tensive region of excellent
meadow land.
   Oak and Black Pines-of 
Small sizes, but suitable for
ordinary building purposes-
are the principal Kinds
of timber.
   Webster's ferry across
the Wisconsin river is in the
N.E. corner of Section 1-
and the Township is so
situated that all communication
from Portage City & the adjacent
country with the Lemonwier Pine-
ry & the Mississippi, illegible pass
through it, either by way of the Ferry
above named or of the Dell bridge
below.

  The soil of this township is generally
good. Timber of medium quality
Oak & pine.  Considerable improvement
in the NE corner  Roger's mill in
Section 21 is doing considerable business
Though the lumber procured there is
not of the best quality  The land imme
diately along the Lemonwier is much cut
up by slues low wet & of little value

T16NR5E
 The Northern & Eastern portions of this
township are principally swamp & marsh
 The marshes produce excellent grass & are
at present the sole dependence of the settlers
for hay & I think the soil of the Swamps
is well adapted to growing grass consequently
I have not returned either swamps or Marshes
as unfit for cultivation. The prairie extending
through this town is at present equivalent
to a marsh but I am told that in ordinary
seasons it is quite dry & the vegetation
appears to indicate rather a dry soil
 There is a strip of good country near the
river on the east side that is densely
settled & considerably improved.

very poor  There is some tolerably 
good timber along the Roche A Cree
   I have not returned the swamps as
unfit for cultivation for they are the
only portions of the township that are
good for anything & they are fit only for
growing grass & cranberries
           The town as a whole is of little
value

Township 18 North, Range 5 East

 This township has in com=
mon with its neighbors,
a very light Sandy soil;
but the timber, and the
vegetation upon the Surface
indicate more natural
fertility than most of the
country possesses.
The Surface is broken only
by the Roche-a-cris Creek,
  The Surface is generally level
although in places Some=
what undulating.
 The timber is mostly "Barrens"
or "Openings". No heavy tim=
ber of any account.

	General Description
 This township is blessed with a 
Soil, which for fertility would
rival the Desert of Sahara.
With the exception of a portion in the
western part, the timber is of the most
inferior and despicable quality.
  In the western part is Some little
very good firewood, and occasionally
a rail cut. Along the banks of a 
Slough of the Wisconsin river,(com=
monly Known as the Half moon creek) has 
been some very good Pine timber, but the
enterprise and energy of the pioneer
lumberman has long since removed 
it to a better country.
The aforesaid Slough & the Wisconsin in 
the NW, and the Dead Horse Slough in
the S E is the only water of any account
 The Surface in the southern part is

Black Pine and Black Oak is about
the prevailing timber by much more
than a two thirds majority.

in this town.

Copy, Township No.20 North,Range No.5 East
      4th Meridian
	General Description
This township is remarkably well
watered. The Wisconsin crawls
through it in a Serpentine manner
the water of its creeks are pure and
wholesome. The timber is generally
Black Pine & Black Oak.
In some of the timber bottoms can 
be found most of the varieties
usually found in this latitude.
What little land there is in this township
worth taking as a gift is on the bottoms &
liable to inundation. The balance is as
usual 3rd rate. The Surface is gen=
erally undulating the most level
portion is on the west of the
Wisconsin River.

The character of the Soil in this town is very
uniform. The Uplands are all pine barrens
on a light Sandy Soil, the timber nearly all
burned off by the yearly Indian fires. The 
large pines, valuable for lumber are all gone
The bottom lands tho somewhat better, and 
sandy & not sufficiently large to make
them valuable. Inhabitants are very
scarce there being a single house at 
PoBausse, a noted place for refitting
rafts after passing the rapids before their final departure for the
Mississippi, & a French hamlet
on Section 1 -  On the whole, it may
be said of this town that for soil or lumber
it is nearly worthless. The Islands in
the river are all overflowed & are neither
valuable for size, soil or timber & were, therfore
not meandered

T22NR5E
  The East & South East portion of this Town
consists of alternate ridges of pine barrens and
Tamurack Swamps. There is a small portion
of land near the river that is tolerably fair
but the bottoms on the river are worthless owing to
their being overflowed nearly every year.
 The West & north parts of the Town consist
of a portion of the great Cranberry Marsh
which extends to & beyond Yellow river. The Marsh
is wet & unfit for cultivation & has upon it small
Islands(so called) of hard land with a few trees; &
scattering Pines, Tamaracks & Blk Oaks are
found nearly all over it, so much so that 
we almost invariably found bearing trees for our
Corners. The Marsh may be valuable for the Cranberries
which it produces abundantly but otherwise
is entirely worthless
