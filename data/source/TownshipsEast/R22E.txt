Attraction, an applicable to this

T15NR22E
T.15N.R.22E. of the 4th
Meridian is an excellent
township for agricutural
purposes. It is level, but not
as much so as to render it
too wet. It will be seen by the 
field book that it abounds
in Sugar Groves - the finest
I ever saw. The Indians, it
is believd, yearly manufactured
great quantities of Sugar there
from. The swamps and other
wet grounds mentioned in
the field-Notes, may be all
easily drained - upon which
they will become the west 
part of the township, especially
for grass.

There may be a deficiency 
of Stones on some of the 
Sections; but the bed of the 
River will afford an inexhaust
able store
	It is abundantly
supplied with excellent 
Water. The River Shebowegan
winds nearly thro' the middle
of it- and its tributaries inter-
sect almost every Section
Excellent Clay for bricks
and Lime Rock are in 
great plenty.
	For Mill-sites it
cannot well be surpassed.
     The river is rapid and will
afford any number that may
be wanted. On Section 36
are several of uncommon
value. There are three perpen
dicular falls not far apart of 
about five feet each.

T16NR22E
In addition to the remarks upon
the several sections contained
in the foregoing field-notes
It may be said that this is
a good Township of land.
 Altho' the Tam Marsh and 
swamp often illegible, it is 
to be understood that neither 
of them are so bad as not to
be susseptable of cultivation
by draining - an opperation
which will be resorted to after
the dry lands are brought into
use. The most of them will
make fine grass land.
     There is a considerable quan
tity of good white pine between
the Memee and Shebowegan
Rivers. Either of these streams
afford Mill sites equal in 
number to the future wants of 
the country. Nearly every Section
is abundantly watered by them or their
tributaries. The township appears
not to abound in Rock - but 
a good supply may be had in
the beds of the streams. The
land is sufficiently level; but not
so much so but that the water is

rapidly drained off. Fine
Sugar groves abound; and the 
swamps will afford a good
supply of Ash for fencing.
For this use they will be of 
value.
	The water is of good
qualtiy, altho' it is believed
to be moderately saturated with
Lime. It is now Marsh; and
altho' somewhat cold, it is in
the whole agreeable weather
As I have several times
remarked before, nothing can
exceed the mellow and beautiful
tints of the atmosphere and in
the night time the brilliancy
of the Stars. There is not much
cloudy weather- nor any or
verry fast, strong currents of air
No country that I have ever
seen exceed or equal it in these respects
 These remarks may not be
of much value - they would
however be otherwise to me were
I ever to become a settler here

	The west part of this Township
is remarkable for some small sharp
ridges, mostly beech timber. The
runs of water, are mostly from Spring
fountains.- The soil is gravelly, &
nearly 1st rate.- Primitive rocks
are scattered over the surface, but
not in such quantity as to em
illegible cultivation.-
         the south part, is by far the 
best - Bass & Sug. Maple abounds.

This Township I have estimated as one of 
the best I have surveyed in the Menomo
nee Purchase. The soil, timber, &
face of the Country, are generally well
adapted to farming.- Beautiful
groves of Pine timber are frequent,
& near to the River._
  Manintoowoc on the E. part of 
the township, is rapid - west half
it is gentle, rather sluggish:-
I have marked too fully which
will afford beautiful, & valuable
Mill Sites - 

T20NR22E
 The stream passing through this Town
ship, is one which will eventually be
of great value.- It is sufficiently
large for common milling purposes;
has considerable fall, rocks bottom
and banks, and affords numerous
good sites.- There is also an
abundance of good Pine on its 
banks._
    The soil is good - much of it
1st rate, well watered & timbered,
And on the whole must be ranked
as a township of 1st rate land.

T21NR22E
	The South-eastern part
of this Township, has a good share
of first rate land; The North part
has considerable Hemlock timber.-
The middle, is somewhat broken;-
though none so much So as to render
it unfit for easy tillage. The soil
generally, is free from Clay; and 
consists of a sandy loam & gravel
very rich and deep. The most prin
cipal Stream ( a branch of the " Twin
River," sufficient for a considera
-ble water power, and has some
good Sites near the East bound
ary. The Swamps are deep, and 
Some of them extensive: The land
however between them & the dry

land. Pine timber, Suitable for
Boards & Shingles, though not very
abundant, is found more or less,
through the township.-

T22NR22E
   Hemlock & Pine are the prevailing kinds
of timber in this Township; though there
are a few Sections on the E side of "the
Creek " which have mostly Maple & Bass.
  These sections, are the most valuable.-
The Pine timber is of the best Kind, be
ing large, thrifty, Strait, Sound, & free from
limbs. The Hemlock is Scrubby, and
winding.- The soil is a rich loam,
neither sand, clay, nor gravely, but
a mixture of all, and probably very
strong. The Brooks, especially those rising
in the N.E. are durable;-It is in
fact a well watered Township.

T23NR22E
   The greater part of this Township
is covered with hemlock & Pine
timber, and must be rated as 2d rate
land - Sections 1.2..11.& 12, are excep
tions, having maple & Beech timber,
and being 1st rate land.- The 
middle & northern parts, are quite level
-the southern part is broken.-

T24NR22E
  The general face of this Township is level
or gently rolling, abounding in swamps
of all sizes from which small Creeks
run in Every direction - being the summit
level between the Bog & Lake.
   Lime rock may be found in the N West
part of the Town at from 6 to 18 inches below
the surface in ledges.
   The Timber Except N.W. part is very
dense of W Pine B.Ash Sugar Beech &c
with much under growth & fallen Timber
Especially in the swamps.
    Much of the soil of a red clayey loam
with sand mixture ranking upon an average
(Except swamps) at 2d rate-
    No Springs or mill sites noticed, but
the water is generally good.

   The foregoing township is mostly

     In this township there
are a few sections of second
rate Beech & Maple lands   The 
soil is generally clayey and
stoney   There is no Pine
of any value in the township
except a small grove in sections
8 & 17 - so far from any water
course  as to be of no value
for lumber

   There are no good farm
lands in this Township
   It is pretty well timbered with
Pine. And the most of the Pine for 
the Peshetego mills is taken from
here    The land is generally
level and sandy.  The banks
of the river like those of the Menom
are from 5 to 12 feet in heighth
Timbered to the waters edge.  The
river is rapid and in sections
34 a good mill site may be
obtained

 This Township is generally
level with a light Sandy Soil
There is some good pine timber 
but that near the river has been
