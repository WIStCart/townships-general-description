	General Remarks
The township afore described is
almost wholly rolling, 1st.rate prairie
	In the south and southeastern
part of the township there is a 
small settlement of farmers but no
mines are found within its limits -

T2NR3E
	General Remarks
 The township to which the afore
going notes relate is mostly high
dry, rolling, 1st rate prairie-
  There are no mines discovered in
the township except on the line
between sections 30 and 31 where
lead has been found in small quan
tities, and the only house or improve
ment in the township is at the same 
place-
  The mounds in the prairie at the
Section corners, are made square at the base
and about 3 feet high - those at the 1/4 S.
corners are circular and 2 1/2 feet high
	
T3NR3E
	General Remarks
Township N: 3 N. in R 3 E.(N.W.
Terr. of the U.S.)  is mostly made
up of rolling, 2d rate land, the 
greater part of which is timbered
with white, black, and bur Oak
   In Section 9 there is a settle=
ment of 6 or 7 families at a 
place called "Willow Spring"  where
there are one or two furnaces for
smelting lead ore.  Lead ore how=
ever is not found in any con=
siderable quantity within the limits
             of the township, and
most of the inhabitants get their
living by farming.

	12,3 General Description
The land in the first two tiers of Sections(Eastern)
in this Township  are gently rolling, rich
and-with the eception of the scarcity
of water well adapted to agriculture
 It is heavily timbered with a thrifty 
growth of Oaks & Aspen. The balance
with the exception of the small prairies in the Northern
part, with some other small exceptions as noted
is hilly and broken, and below a 
medium as a farming country.
 The general appearance of the country about
the corner of Sects 1.2.11.12 seemed to denote
the existence of Lead ore.

T13NR3E
13,3 General Description
 This township is much broken:-
and as a whole quite barren, being 
almost useless as a farming country.
It is intersected by numerous small
streams:- having low and sterile bottom
lands, Skirted by high precipitous
and rocky Bluffs  which rise irregular-
-ly in every direction:- in many places
presenting fronts of bare Sandstone;and
in others covered by a thin soil which 
appears to be only the decomposition
of the soft Sandstone upon which
the whole country is based. There are
some exceptions to this general descrip=
=tion, among which Sections 11.& 35 illegible
most conspicuous;being very fertile.
  Neither is it valuable as a lumbering
country: the ordinary timber being short
and scrubby,-and the Pine not suffi=
=ciently plenty or of a quality to make it
of much consequence.That in Sects 13.
14.23 & 24 is knotty.  There is however a

body of Pine timber commencing in Sect's
5 & 6 and extending in a North Westerly
direction, which is of a better quality, and
from which a considerable number of logs 
have already been cut. This was the occasion
of the erection of the "Cabins " noted on the 
South side of those Sections
   Of its capabilities as a mining country
the Surveyor is not competent to judge -
 but from the general appearance of the
country,- its contiguity to the "diggings " on
T.12.R.4.E where a considerable amount of cop=
=per ore has been raised;-and its resemblance
to other mining countries that have come
under his observation,- he thinks the
probabilities are that it will prove of
some value in this respect.
   The Barabo River is a narrow,deep,
and very Serpentine stream,- being 
about 60 feet in width on the surface
of the water:-and below the mouth of the 
Creek in 25 from 8 to 12 feet in depth

Above this it generally diminishes in
depth. On the line between 6 & 7 it is
at low water about 2 1/2 feet.
   The whole Township is one immense
thicket of Scrub Oak, Hazel, illegible, Alder
&c almost impenetrable.

There are numerous deep

Township 15 North, Range 3 East 4th Meridian
In the East half of this

level .In the West it is
broken and hilly. The former 
is covered with Bur and White
Oak openings : the latter, with 
heavy Oak timber of the

best quality . The soil in
the East is frequently Sandy:
in the West it is mud 
almost entirely. In all
parts it is well adapted
to agricultural purposes: and
is especially so on the banks
of One mile creek and its 
tributaries , which are already
covered with farms and fields,
varying in extent from forty
to 100 acres.
	Around illegible mill
in Section 12 there is quite a
thriving settlement ; and in Section
illegible on the head waters of Two-
mile creek, there is a set-
tlement of Norweginns. The indus-
try and illegible characteristic of
the Settlers on the Indian land are illegible

Township 15 North, Range 3 East 4th Meridian
plainly exhibated.
That portion of the Township, North
of the Lemonwier is not very val-
uable- owing to the back water
of the mill pond. The various
creeks before mentioned and also
One-mile bluff are named accord-
ing to their respective distances from
Manghis mill.

T16NR3E
That portion of this Township lyihg North of the Le-
monwier is a Blk Pine region, interspersed with
dense Aspen thickets, marshes & Tamarac Swamps,

& is wholly unimproved, the soil,(except perhaps
in some of the lands of the Lemonwier) being too
poor & the timber of too little value to attend
the pioneer while so many of the fertile valleys
of the West remain unsettled. But South of the Le-
monwier a better country is found. The Soil is a rich
mud with Sand sufficient to render it light and
nearly every 1/4 Section is claimed. On many of
these claims are fine improvement. The best 
are those in Sec.8 in the neighborhood of Finley's mill.
