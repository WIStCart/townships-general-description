The general appearance of this 
Town is- a rolling surface- illegible
broken- The timber generally
poor and none that is valuable
The soil 2d or 3d rate and the
improvements consisting of about
7 Dwelling and 125 acres improved
are illegible character-
The bank of the wisconsin through
a part of the Town sees a con=
tinuation of the Dells and the banks
are high and rocky and the river
more confined than a usual average
width- The river is quite free of
Islands and those in the illegible part
are not very valuable

T14NR6E
A general description of this Town em-
braces perhaps as great a variety of
topography, as is often found within the
limits of a single Township: On the East we
have level prairie, not valuable however
of thin soil and destitute of water, more in=
terior we find almost barren land ridges until

Township 14 North range 6 East 4 Meridian
we approch the Wisconsin river, where a more thrifty growth
of timber indicates better soil,though little that may 
be called 1st or 2d rate=The character of soil & surface
west of the river is quite like the left bank,though above
the Dells,the surface is somewhat lower,- The whole
surface of the town is level is gently rolling, except in the
vicinity of the Dells where it is interrupted with
high Hills-perpendicular Ledges,or deep chasms,-
The river also presents many changes= of more than
general average & width,- changing sand beds & inter=
spersed with Islands above the Dells and within
the same confined to narrow limits, with rapid
current and high perpendicular rocks=The volume 
of water at one point,between projecting rocks,being
confined to limits of 53 feet=The improvements, about
450 actres cultivated and the dwellings about 15
are generally not of substantial character and
poor indeed     June 16 1857

 The greater part of this township is 
poor & sandy. In the northern &
eastern portions there are many abrupt
bluffs of stone ranging from 10 to 150 feet
in height.  Water is extremely scarce
& Timber poor.  There is some improvements
in the western part where the soil
is of good quality & there are 2 or 3 
springs of water

T18NR6E
Township 18 North, Range6 East
	4th Meridian
 This township, as will be seen
by the accompaning deagram
is remarkably well watered with
Small creeks. 
 These Streams have their Source 
in marshes, and are generally
fed by Springs issuing from 
their banks. They all answer to
the same general description,
viz: low Sandy banks and bottoms;
gentle current. The two most
Southerly, although affording
plenty of water, cannot be
considered good mill Streams,
as the banks are too low to obtain
Sufficient "head" without over =
flowing the bottom to an unwar=
rantable extent. the bottoms, are 
generally flanked with abrupt
Sand bluffs from 10 to 40 ft in height.

These bottoms contain the only
good timber in the township
with the exception perhaps of
Some very good Burr Oak in Sections
28.29.32. and 33. They are subject 
to inundation, and are gener=
ally Somewhat marshy.
They are well adapted to the 
cultivation of grass.
 The upland in this township
is very poor and very Sandy:
affording little or no vegetation
excepting  Black Oak Brush- which
seems to be a Spontaneous production
of Superfluous abundance.
 The Chief timber is Black Pine,
and Black or Pin Oak.
In the East half of section 30 is 
the famous Roche=a=cris, or Castle 
rock. This rock rises to an

Elevation of Some 300 feet perpendicular.
It is very soft Sand Stone.
On its Sides, hieroglyphics, of
antiquated appearances can
be found to any Extent. In 
some places 10 to 100 Square ft
are closely written in these
characters. From appearances they
must have been written centuries
ago. They would afford interesting
occupation to the Antiquarian,
and are certainly worthy of a
detailed investigation.
In Sections 31 and 32 is a Mound
of about the Same Elevation,
which Seemed to Exert consid=
rable influences over the needle.
 In Surveying this township,
I have randomed over forty
miles of North and South lines.

The Variations have been so 
large and So Sudden as to
give me Some uneasiness.
 There Seems to be quite an
amount of Local Attraction:
not very Strong: but enough
to give more confidence in
the chain and Ranges than
in the needle. 
This Attraction is very generally
diffused throughout the whole
township.

T19NR6E
Township N.19 N. Range N.6 E.
  the 4th Principal Meridian
 The South half of this township
is quite free from marshes, or
very nearly so. The Roche-a-cris
and tributaries leave it tolerably
well watered. The bottoms of 
the Streams are very narrow
and low, and liable to in=
undation. I have not entered
them as unfit for cultivation;
for I consider them, together
with the Marshes as the most
valuable portions of the town=
Ship, and without which the
balance would be almost worth=
less. The bottoms and marshes,
although liable to an annal
inundation, are far more
Suitable for the cultivation of
grass, than the dry lands are 
for an;y kind of cultivation .

Township N.19 N. Range N.6 E.

 The North half of this town=
Ship is completely spotted
]with marshes.  Many of 
them are already very
valuable for Cranberrys :
yielding at the rate of from
200 to 400 bushels pr acre.
 A very large proportion of this 
township is covered with
a dense growth of Black
Oak Brush.
 The timber on the Roche-a-
cris is all that is of any
value. Even that is but of
very little account .
This township is infested with
a very worthless Species of 
Pine: commonly termed Black
Pine.It can be found on Each of the
Smallest legal subdivisions.

T20R6E
Township No.20 North.Range No.6 East
       4th Meridian
         General Description
The topography of this town =
Ship is very much diversified.
The South Eastern     Sections
are very level, consisting of
swamps and marshes ,
with an unusual paucity
of timber, the balance of the
township is mostly undulating,
although about the vicinity of
the Creeks, quite rolling and
in some instances quite 
broken. The Daracvasha
mound in the South is a 
conspicuous land mark for
many miles around.
The timber is chiefly Black
Pine. Black Oak in limited
quantities can be found .
 
 As usual, the Brush is abundant.
In this township it was impossible to
conform to the instructions in regard to
Bearings, in every intance.
Where I have placed the BT beyond the 
given distance (10 chains), will be found
no trees of suitable quality & besides it
was impossible to raise a mound be =
cause the ground was nothing but a bed
of mortar to the of five feet.
Consequently I placed a large stake 5 feet
below the surface and 3 feet above.
Had I possessed sufficient force to have 
placed a rock of suitable dimensions I
would cheerfully have done it .
A rock of the size required by my special 
instructions would be covered under five feet
of mud the minute it left my hands.
 The Soil is universally 3rd rate .

T21NR6E
The Character of this town is easily described
It is a uniform pine barren. Soil white
sand. Poor & worthless for all farming purposes

is not probably a Single quarter Section

 The character of the land varies very
considerably in this town but none
of it can rank above third rate.
The Southern portion Consists of
pine barrens, the timber mostly gone

timber is principally pine of the
Variety Known as Pitch, Bastard or
Blk Pine, of very little use either
for fuel or lumber. The north part
of the Town is principally Marsh
very wet & entirely unfit for cultivation.
 Large portions of the Marshes are
covered with Cranberry vines which
every alternate year produce 
large crops-
