 The land out of Marsh in this 
township is of good quality 1rst
2d rate, slightly rolling - poorly
watered & rather scantily timberd _ how
ever much of the timber is of good
quality _ the Prairie is fine _
    Aux Plaines (as in all the other 
Townships) is a deep, wide, marsh
with or without a channel, as 
the case may be, water too stagnant
to use in the winter , prolific
in muskrats & illegible - yet
there cannot be found better or more
beautifully situated Prairie in the Town than
on its banks through the whole of 
Range 21.

This Township Genraly Speaking is 
good Land Surface Rolling but 
nothing like hills excepting on the 
Menominy which is nothing but Bluffs
and very few of them the highest
of which is not 100 feet
        Timber is good with very little
exception
	Stone is not very plenty on

and Lime Stone Lime Stone
appears below the surface which
is in the bottom of Runs Brooks

	There is much old improvement
through out this Township consistant
of rows Simular to Corn rows where 
is plain to be seen and covered
with the present groth of Timber
There is also some Small Mounds
I have not kept a record of those

 This is a good township for
farmers. - None can well
be better watered. The West
Shebowegan and its tributaries
intersect it in almost every
direction-affording Mill sites
in number equal to its future
wants Several of the noblest
springs in the country are
found here. It surpasses almost
any other place in Sugar tree
-and is thickly covered with 
other valuable timber_especi-
ally good rail timber. The soil
will produce good crops of Wheat
Rye, Oats, illegible and Potatoes
perhaps Indian Corn. It is
sheltered from the cold Winds
of the West & north west, by
the elevated ground in that
quarter. January 13th 1835

 This township is good
It is however some little
broken; but not enough 
as to be much injurious
And as tho' it is not tra-
versed by any considerable 
streams of Water, except at
the N. E. and N.W. corners
it is sufficiently well watered
No Mill sites were
observed - altho' it is 
believed Mills might be 
made to opperate well
on the River near the 
two northern angles of 
the township _ its rapid
current justifies such an
opinion. The Iron Rock
is found here and gave 
us much trouble by it

T17NR21E
  The S.E. part of this Town is 
somewhat broken; considerable
quanty of excellent Pine timber -
among the hilly ridges.-
  The surface of the whole s
dotted with boulders - quartz &
Mica - also a large reddish
stone, with specks of of fine
silex, through the blocks; by 
some called Garnett, is quite 
frequent.
    The soil , is 1st rate, well
watered & timbered.- The Swamps
are small & the lakes have
fish in them;  it will prob
ably be a rich township
    The Sheboygan is 100 feet
wide; has plenty of water &
affords numerous good Mill
sites.

    This Township has a large proportion
of those wet, bottom lands, on the Mani
toowoc, which give significance to the 
Indian name, "Devils Den River." 
They are always under water, & at some
seasons from 3 to 8 feet under-
Tamarack, soft maple, Alder- Willow &
Elm, grow in these swamps.-
The river is sluggish, but wide, deep,
and navigable!- wile in the towns
below, it is wet, in many places above
50 links wide - just water enough
for a Mill ! -
	About half (the S.E) of the 
Township is a dense  swamp
& very wet- the other half has some
beautiful sections of land - inDeed
all that is out of swamp is rich
land. 

T20NR21E
    The South part of this Town
ship[ is 2 rate - W. & N.W.
parts,(out of swamp) are the very
1st rate.- the lines between swamp
& dry ground are very bold. 

T21NR21E
	The Northwest, and west
parts of this Township are the best.
 The other parts, having more swamp.
Much of it truly first rate. Sand
Stone ledges (small) are frequent, on
& near the principal Stream.
Mill Sites are frequent, though 
small. Large Springs of beauti
ful, clear water are frequent,
in the N. W. part.- The land
is undulating, & many beauti
ful "building spots " were obser
ved on & near the principal
Stream. 

T22NR21E
   This Township is for the most part
indifferent land. - It is very level, and
a great part of it, wet land. The prevail
ing timber is pine, a great share of which
is suitable for lumber of different
Kinds.  The soil, is clay, or, as it is 
sometimes called, red loam. In the beds
of the largest brooks, lime & sand stone
gravel is found; but few stone of 
any Kind are to be found on the sur
face.- In the dry season, there 
might be a want of water; as all 
the little brooks appear to have their
sources from the marshes.

     This town contains some of the 
best Pine timber in this part of
the country. Sections 14,17,18 19 & 20
especially are well timbered with White
Pine intermixed with some Yellow and
Norway Pine    The soil in Places
may be called 2d rate and would 
answer for cultivation. It is of
the light Sandy character peculiar to
Pine lands    The lake is clear &
shallow with a Sand & Stone
beach adjoining the dry land, but
next to the Marsh & Swamp is Muck
with some sand thrown upon it
by the action of the waves 

T33NR21E
  The soil of Town 33 R 21 is 
light & sandy and worth but little
for cultivation.   There is some Pine,
but so much scattered as to be of no
value for lumbering purposes
     The Banks of the river are from four
to ten feet in heighth rising gradually
as you recede from the river. In
the bends of the river there is some
good bottom lands-but are subject
to innundation   The Two Lakes
are clear & shallow with Marshy
banks the most of the way round them
   The menomonie is deep & sluggish

T34NR21E
 Sections 4.5.6.7.8.9.17 & 18
are rocky & broken covered
with a sparse growth of Pine
mostly Yellow & Norway with a 
thick undergrowth of aspen Birch
Ceder & Hazle     The remainder
of the Town is Hilly-also timbered
with Pine mostly norway & an 
undergrowth of Birch & aspen
 The river has a pretty uniform
current of about 5 miles
an Hour   The Table Land
along near the river is about
20 feet above the river  and
like the rest of the Town is Sandy
   There is not sufficient bottom
Land in any one place for
a farm.
