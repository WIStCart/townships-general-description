hard and stony in places - but many first rate

general depth 15 feet with little Cement
except at mouth,     it discharges
itself over a gravel bed into the Lake where
the width is only 1 chain & depth 2 feet in

of construction -.
   There are 4 Indian Lodges on Head land at the 
mouth, on which also is a corn & potatoe field
of about 2 acres

of this Fraction will rank at 2d rate:

of the Town.    Small parcels of the same
discription may be found in Various
