The highlands of this Township are generally tolerably well
supplied with Oak timber of pretty good quality and not much
undergrowth.  The valleys of the brooks and small streams 
are wide, with but little timber and no brush, affording
facilities for making farms.  The plains lying between 
the hills and the Lake are sandy, with Black and Bur 
Oak timber.
The prarie, covering about two sections, is very hand-
=some but sandy, and not sufficiently rich to produce
much grain or vegetables.
There are at present three dwelling houses, within 
the Township, the location of which, and the extent of
improvements are given in the notes foregoing.

T24NR15W

This is a very rough, hilly and broken 
Township of land, being situated near
the forks of the Mississippi and 
Chippewa rivers.  On many of the 
ridges there is good oak timber.
The North East part - that portion 
lying North East of Plum creek is 
thickly timbered with Ironwood, ash,
white walnut, aspen, hickory -
But in the aggregate it is thinly timber=
=ed and covered with brush - in
some places the brush is very thick, and 
in others so scattering, with but very 
little timber, that it is almost entitled 
to the name of prarie - perhaps the 
term Brushy Prarie woud convey 
the best idea of a great portion of it.
There are no settlers here yet, and apparent
=ly but little inducement for them.

T25NR15W

This Township is thickly timbered with an entire unbroken
body of beautiful timber, with the exception of the southern
portions of sections 31, 32, 33 and 34 - which are covered with
brush - the country about Plum Creek is broken into 
hills and abrupt precipices, but on the plains forming
the dividing ridges with other streams, it is very handsome
being one continued orchard of Sugar trees, with a propor
=tionate quantitiy of other fine timber.
It is watered by Plum Creek and its tributaries, the
waters of which are bright and pure, containing 
some trout.
The bluffs all contain sandstone and flint in
abundance.

desirable tracts for 
farming puposes in the
