Township 11 North Range 1 West 4th Mer

The surface of this Town-
ship is very Hilly the soil
the soil in the Eastern part
is poor 3rd rate, in the 
Western part it is 1st
and 2nd rate, The Timber
is of 1st rate in quality
and Stands very Thick 
on the ground,
The water generally is very
clear and runs very rapid,
there are four Families 
in this Township and 
each one has some improve-
ments,
Upon examination I found 
no evidence of any lines
or corners in this 
Township

T12NR1W
		General Description
	The most remarkable feature about 
this Township as well as that immediately
West of it is its great quantity of water
at the source of almost every branch there	
is a bold & apparantly never failing Spring
	The quantity of water increases so fast as
you go down these branches that within a 
short distance you have a mill seat
& indeed many of the largest springs
would turn a good deal of machinery
at the fountain head.  That in Sec 4 is 
the largest seen in the township.  The  
timber is chiefly Sugar Maple, Lynn & Elm
The bottoms are all wet, & covered thickly
with Alder brush.  The hills are not
as high in this as in the former Town.
	There seems to be wild game of 
every description almost, with the excep-
tion of Turkies.  & it is probably too cold
for them.  Streams are all rapid.

T13NR1W
		General Description
	This Township is generally broken
but the hills are not so high as on the Kick-
apoo, & its being broken brings it under the denom-
ination of 2nd rate land, but the timber is 
very fine & stands thick on the surface; White &
Black & some Bur Oak some of it very large,
Sugar Maple, Lynn, Elm, Ash, Walnut & Hickory
Undergrowth is thick_ Oak, Maple, Prickly Ash,
Alder, Thorn & vines.  As seen by the accompanying
diagram there is a great quantity of water,
& the Branches are rapid.  There are many 
"Land slides" (so to speak) where near the top
of the hills the water seems to have collected
under ground in large quantities till its
reservoir would sustain the weight no
longer, when it burst out, uprooting the 
largest trees & carrying in its current im-
mense blocks of sandstone; they look like
quarries & the stone is good for Masonry.
	There has been more done here by Boyd Illegible
heretofore but all to no effect.
