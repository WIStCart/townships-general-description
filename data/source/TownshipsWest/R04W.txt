The land of the two eastern

ing and 2d. rate. The remainder
of the Township east of the 
river, except the low, wet bottom
of the river, averaging about 15
chs. in width,_ is broken and
Stony_ 3d rate. The timber,
excepting four secs., was nearly all
blown down by a recent Huricane
	The west side of the 
river, with the following ex-
ceptions, is a broken barren,
with here and there a black

of Hall's creek, averaging about
20 chs. in width, and occasion
ally strips along the river
are excellent prairie. Ha-

This Township, in point of 
land and Timber is of little
value. It is little else than
a rude complication of hills
and ridges, utterly destitute
of uniformity. The surface of 
these ridges and hills is cov-
ered with quartzy formations.
The western bottom of the R., and
of the streams which empty upon
that side are good prairie_
	The eastern
bottom of the river is wide, but
low, and marshy, covered with 
a thick growth of Prickly ash, thorn, alder
aspen & vines. The bottoms of the
streams upon this side are narrow
covered, also, with undergrowth 
	The timber, upon the east
side, including maple, oak and 
elm, would rank with the 
second quality. Upon the west
side it is scarce, and of no value what
ever, except for fire-wood.

The two middle tier of Sect. of this Township are situa
ted mostly upon the summit between a large 
creek upon the west, and the Kickapoo river upon the east
The surface of this summit is high, rolling and uniform_
the timber good but scattering. The spurt which make off
from this main summit are at first moderate in their
slopes_ covered with flint and limpid and brown quartz-
but rapidly increase in illegible, until they ter-
minate in nearly perpendicular cliffs of sand rock.
The soil of these spurs is thin & poor, the timber scattering and of little
value. The valley of the laid creek, araging from
15 to 20 chains in width, is a dry productive prairie.
	I visited and examined the ground purporting upon
the plats to contain mineral, but was not able to discov-
er any very desided traces of such existence_ the geology
of the country, I think, forbids it. The springs in the 
neighborhood, have redish cast, the water being slight
tinctured with a illegible_ this, in fact, was the 
only difference I could discover, between this and the
other portions of my ??????

	The water of the streams
is pure, The soil is 
generally sandy mixed with
gravel and clay
	It is all well
timbered and White Pine
Yellow Pine & Hemlock are 
abundant for lumbering
purposes  The Stream
poping through the middle

mill priviliges and is

all illegible plenty-of Brook

T50NR4W
	This Township is val
-uable for the Pine timber
which is scattered over

Most of it is of me

many places it stands
very thick.  Mr Julius
Austrien has a Saw Mill
in opperation in the 
NW1/4 of Section 21.
The stream on which
it stands the having
sufficient fall and 
banks at various places
for mill purposes is 
of no great importance
as it only affords a
supply of water during
the wet part of the sea-
-son. The township is 
to broken for agricultu-
ral purposes. A range
of high hills traverse the

among which were found

	General Remarks,
	The land of this Town-
ship is well adapted to 
agriculture. The soil is 
a light-sandy loam,
The surface is generally
dry, being sufficiently
rolling to secure drain-
age. There are no
streams of sufficient 
size to form a good
motive power for mills.
In the interior are extensive
sugar orchards, from which
the natives make consider-
able maple sugar, No rocks
were found in place on 
this Township, but it
belongs to the sand-stone
formation and is overland
by drift, in some places
to the depth of several
hundred feet. No houses
or other improvements
were noticed.

T52NR4W
General Remarks
	The land of this
Township is of inferior quality,
the portion on the main
land is the best, but it
decends rapidly toward
the lake, giving it a 
northern aspect-unfavor-
able to agriculture.
On the main land 
there is some good 
Hemlock & White Pine
timber.
