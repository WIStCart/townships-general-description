General Description
Sections 1, 2, 3 + 10 and parts of sections
11+12 of this Township have, generally,
a first rate clay & loam soil resting 
on limestone formation; they are most
ly well timbered with Sugar, Linden,
Elm, W+B oak, Butternut & Ironwood,
but are destitute of water.  Section 5
& 6 and part of section 7, 8+9 are on a 
high sandy bottom, part prairie & part
Oak openings.  The Islands & lands border
on the river & Lake are mostly low rich
bottoms which are subject to innundtion
to the depth of from 2 to 6 feet.  This 
portion is timbered with Maple, Willow, Cot=
tonwood Hackberry & Elm & has several sugar camps
on it.  The bluffs bordering on Lake Pepin
are three or four hundred feet high & rise
in perpendicular ledges, the first or low-
-est of which is of sandstone formation &
ristes to about one fourth the height of the
bluff.  The upper strata is Magnesium 
limestone.

General Description
The eastern and northern portion of this 
Township (including sections 1,2,3,10,11,
12,13,14,23,24,25,26,35+36) and sections 
,78+17 have a rich productive soil, gen
tly rolling surface and are well tibered,
though poorly watered.  Along the stream 
running through the centre of the Township
are valuable rush bottoms, with a very
thick growth of prickley Ash, thorn, goose-
berry and hornbeam brush.  The remainder 
of the township is broken and brushy, but 
generally well timbered.  Sections 17,18,
19,20,29+30 are covered with very dense
Aspen thickets, These, together with the sections
south of them seem to have no water on
them.  The bluffs on each side of the large 
stream are high & steep, but the lands on the
summits & lying back have fine heavy
timber and a good soil.  This large streams 
runs rapidly & is clear, cold water af-
fording an abundance of fine brook 
trout.  The township abounds with bears.
elk, dee, fisher and martin.

General Description
The surface of this township is level or gen-
tly rolling except in the vicinity of the dry
beds of streams, appearing in the centre 
and north east part of the township and
in the west par including sections 5,6,
7,8,17,18,19,20,29+30.  There are springs
along the dividing ridge between these dry 
beds, but they sink either in the beds below, 
or before reaching them.  The soil in most
places is a rich sandy loam.  The above 
named sections are on a ragen of lime
stone hills and are finely timbered and 
well watered.  We find a good many bould=
ers over the surface of this township, their 
most southern limit being near the
south boundary in an irregular line run
ning east and west.  The Stream running
out of the Township in section 24 rises in
one large spring in said section.  The timber
is principally Lind, sugar, Elm, W. B. & Br.
oak, butternut, ironwood, cherry & hickory
with P. ash Hazle Hornbeam Fern nettles 
& thorn undergrowth.  Plenty of bear, Elk, Deer,
some martin & fischer.

General Description
The general surface of this Townshi
is gently rolling with some steep 
hills on "Balsam Branch" & lake
"Wah-pug-ga-isco".  The best Pine
land is east of and near this lake
and its inlet; not extending more
than one mile from its waters.  The 
growth on the rest of the Township 
is spruce Bur & Black oak & Aspen
in the South with a dense under
-growth of Hazle & Oak, White black
& Bur Oak Maple Linden & Birch
in the center; & White Walnut, oak &
Elm with Hazle & Prickly Ash bush
in the North.
Lake "Wah-pug-ga-isco" has a 
bald well defined shore with
banks of pebble & snad, in some
places a beautiful beach in 
others "Sucker Branch" its outlet 
has one or more good mill sites, one
at the old dam.  Marshes on the map.
"Balsam Branch" is rapid and sandy
except at the Rice Lack Much is 
Sluggish & impurable.  The road
is onecut by the lumbermen & is
Rough.  the other meanders
Lakes seem deep that in sections 
19,20,29+30 is a fine sheet of water.
Nearly all swamp lands found 
uncultivable, the floating marsh
in sections 27,28,33& 34 has evidently 
once been a deep lake & has a sand 
ridge of 10 foot base & 6 feet hight 
thrown up around it (as supposed)
by the waves and ice.
Soil chiefly 2nd rate, sandy & thin
occasionally we found good 2nd rate
land with pine White & Black Oak
