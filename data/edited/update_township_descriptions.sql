The county was examined for several miles around and the result has been the discovery of several large and valuable leads, principally on Sections 2 and 3 in this town, and 34&35 in T. 3 North of it, and this is now considered one of the richest and most valuable sections of the mining country. Along the Mississippi, on the bottoms, between the bluffs and the river, there is also considerable good land for farms.

('22413','This township has a superabundant supply of water, none of which can be made very valuable either for propellingf machinery or for purposeds of navigation. Chippewa river is generally very wide, its eastern bank low and sandy, whilst the hills on the West side up to the outlet of Dead Lake approach to the river The current is tolerably swift, the water shallow spreading over a wide surface, and being impeded by many small islands and sand bars thus presenting obstacles to navigation except in times of high water, which will continue to exist in all probability until the channel can be deepened by some artificial means Beef Slough is formed by the water escaping from Chippewa river and gradually cutting for itself a channel along near the base of the hills on the East side of the river. It has been caused by the current of water washing down the main channel, East of Beef Island, and driving against the left bank where meeting with sudden resistance has forced for itself another passage. This passage or chute as Beef Slough may be called has gradually become wider and deeper until it would now admit the transit of steamboats at almost all seasons of the year, as far as the Southern boundary of the township, and for 4 or 5 miles further. And were it not for the causes explained in the notes of the next Township South of this, it would be regarded as of immense advantage to the people inhabiting the upper Chippewa coutry for purposes of navigation. As it is however it is a very serious disadvantage to the navigation of Chippewa River taking out about one third of its water, and finally spreading and depositing them in a thousand marshes, ponds, and sloughs. Little Beef Slough is another chute that runs out of Chippewa River and runs into Beef Slough. It is of no material importance, not containing half as much water as Beef Slough, and not being likely ever to increase in size or importance beyond what it now is. Dead Lake is a handsome little body of water, it is kept up by springs, its water is very cledar and near its outlet it is deep. There is no probability that it can ever be drained or that it will dry up. There is a dense forest of first rate timber lying West of Chippewa River and North of Plum creek.

General Remarks The township,to which the forgo= ing notes relate, embraces a portion of country among some of the earliest settlements in the Mining district, and in the hope of finding lead ore al= most every part of the township has at different times, been tried by the miners. Most of the diggings, however, are now abandoned, except those in sections 23. 24. 25 and 26 which still afford profitable employment to the persons engaged in them. The population of the township is mostly located along the \"West Fork T1N,_R1E. (N.W.Terry.) of Fever River\", running through it and is now rather of an agricultural than a mining character. The principle settlements are at Buncomb, Natchez, and Murphy''s Mill, at each of which place, there are about six or eight families. The mill, at the last mentioned place is a grist mill, with two runs of stones; and occupies a site which is one of the best in the western States; and was made by cutting and blasting the rocks to con =siderable depth through a ridge about two chains wide, so as to allow the water of the river to pass and to give it a fall of about twenty feet. The site is on the east half of the N.W. 1/4 of Section 15. T1N._R1E. (N.W.Terry.) The surface of the land in this township is generally rolling, and along the river in some places hilly. The soil is mostly of good quality, and some parts of the township are thinly covered with small trees and bushes of oak. The remainder is prairie. To mark the places of the sectional and 1/4 Section corners on the prairie, mounds of earth are raised agreeably to instructions, and that they may be more easily distin= guished, those at the section corners are made in the form of a frustum of a 4 sided pyramid, and those at the 1/4 section corners in the form of a frustum of a cone. Where trees are marked for Corners, T1N_R1E. (N.W.

('41609','This township, like that East of it in Range 10 is favorably Situated for communication with the Fox River Valley, and with places around it; for though abounding in marshes and swamps, the dry ground is yet continuous in those directions where roads are needed. A dry road, scarcely interrupted by a single slough or marsh, runs through its whole extent from North West to South east, leading in the one direction to Montello at the East end of Buf= falo Lake, and in the other, towards the great Wisconsin Pinery, whose best known villages are Stevens Point and Plover Portage. Unlike Several of the townships in the vicinity, this township does not contain within its limits any considerable Lake. The Mon= tello Creek, always pursuing devious, ser= -pentine course, skirts its northern boundary, and from near a central point between the East and West extremities of the North Town line, takes a direction towards the South East corner of the Township. And wherever this stream flows, may be found pure Sweet water, running in a Swift, copious tide, and rich bottom lands for meadow, subject however, to occasioned inundation, and a variety of excellent timber. Two of the mill-privileges afforded by this stream are already occupied by saw-mills; and there are other mill-sites along this river and Duck Creek, which are not like to be soon occupied, nor needed by the present sparse population. But the pop- =ulation will not probably remain this sparse for a great lenth of time. There is not a little good land within the borders of this township, which is not yet brought under cultivation. One excellent quality of the Soil is its warmth; the silice= =ous element of which glows under the early sun= =shine of Summer, and compensates for the high northern Situation of this region of Country, by the forwardness with which all Kinds of grain grass, roots & melons are . Probably no part of the Menominee tract will ever be capable of Sustaining a dense population, as compared with those parts of wisconsin lying South of the Fox River; but there is abundant room for more imigrants than have yet come to seek homes here, and cultivate these acres And whatever the Soil shall prove itself to be under the hand of continued cultivation, there will at least be found here & doubtless through all coming time, a temporate and beautiful climate.

A few unmarried young men, boarding together at the same house gave name to the Creek already described along which their claims or improvements were located. Nor is the land of a character ever to sustain a large population, much of it being of so poor a soil as not to be worth cultivation. And as is the soil, so is the timber, thin and of little value.

Nearly the whole of the three Eastern tiers of sections, leaving out the tier border= =ing on the Town line, North and South, is marsh.

('42509','General Description. There are two lumbering establishments in this Township-vis. Parker''s, in the Southwest part of Section 5, and Brown''s in the north and middle part of section 18; but much of the valuable pine timber near the course of the Plover has already been cut off. McGregor''s Saw mill is in the township southwest of this. The river Plover is a shallow stream, but at the season of its flood serves to float logs down to the mills below. It enters the township near the N.W. corner, and running a southerly course leaves it near the southwest corner. There may be found millsites in the township along this stream, though, in general, General Description the banks are too low to form a good head. There would be no deficiency of water at any season of the year. The Plover is the only river of a note; but some of the Sources of the Waupaca are be found in Sections 35 and 36. Some of the head waters of the Little Wolf are also met with in the eastern part of the Township. This Township contains Some extensive cedar and Tamarac Swamps, and Spruce and tamarac marsh =es. In the latter division, the spruce trees are seldom more than 10 or 15 feet high, nor more than 3 inches diameter. The open marshes are small and not numerous. The best fine timber is to be found along the N.E. quarter of the township and the three sections immediately South of that tract; and the westward illegible the first and second tiers of sections on the north Side the township. The Surface of this township is more level in the central and northern than in the Southern part Between the first tier of sections both illegible the southeast and southwest sides of the township, a belt of land embracing about four sections from East to West, and two sections wide is almost entirely denuded of trees. This belt consists of bushy Knobs and ridges, generally however with a poor soil, and without streams of water. What rocks there are in the tract are of coarse granite.-'),
('42609','General Description There are several tracts of valuable lumbering pine timber in this Township; the principal of which General Description are in the Western part, and are already being cut upon, and run down the Plover river. Tamarac and cedar swamps are numerous and extensive especially in the Eastern part of the Township, all of them utterly unfit for cultivation & worthless except for their timber, should they ever become acessible by means of roads, to the population south. The Surface is generally level; and the quality of the upland soil seldom rises above second rate; often it falls below.- Nearly the whole surface of the =Township is thickly timbered, the growth being pine, hemlock, tamarac, cedar, birch, maple, lind, poplar and ironwood. There is but little open marsh, and scarcely anything that can be called prairie. There are three lakes of Considerable size, situated one in Sectons 11 and 12; another in sections 17 and 20; and a third, Considerably Smaller in Sections 32 and 33. besides several Smaller ones. Big Plover, which enters the Township in Section 3, running a Southwesterly course, leaves it in Section 31.- It is a shallow stream with a brisk current and can only be used for driving lumber when it is at its flood, in the early spring months. Good mill sites might undoubtedly be found upon it, especially in the northern sectons of its course There is one lumbering establishment located upon Section 16 ( Merrill and Bowdem''''s ); another Howard''s on Section 33.

('42510','Township 25 North Range 10 East, 4th Miridian General Description. This Towship consists of heavily timbered land, a considerable part of it wet and swampy. What is dry, is in general by no means first rate soil. The swamps are chiefly cedar, inter =spersed , however, with tamarac, spruce and ash. Hemlock, though very common, is the product of soil that is more free from water. The propor= =tion of hemlock increases as you advance toward the north part of the Township. Open marshes are comparatively few, and of inconsiderable ex= =tent. The surface is nowhere very abrupt or precipitous, but generally rolling or level: and the hills are not high. A large part of the flat surface is wet and unfit for cultivation: and a portion of that which is dry inclines to be sandy and unproductive. Of the several Kinds of illegible trees indigenous to this region, the species most numerously represented are the hemlock, the cedar the pine, birch, maple, poplar, tamarac, lind and Oak: to which may be added ironwood Township 25 North of Range 10 East of 4th Principal Meridian ash, elm and spruce. The black and white wal= nut are but rarely met with, and the hickory still more rarely. A thick growth of young poplars, is generally indicative of the illegible class of soils. Under the head of Undergrowth, it may be remark= =ed, that ground-pine, wintergreen, Prince''s pine & squaw vine grow every where in this region. The latter, it is said, is commonly illegible by the Indian women, for the purpose of rendering illegible illegible.

There is no lake of much importance; Dakins''s Pond, in the N.W. corner of the town when the dam is completed will flood a large tract of country This place will drive a grist-mill, the only mill as yet built in the Township.-'),
('41811','Town 18 North, Range 11 East,4th Meridian This Township differs from several of the Town= =ships around it, in being more free from marshes, and in having several large and handsome lakes. The face of the Country in the east side is level and open, towards the Fox River; on the west side, it is hilly. The climate is healthful, and much of the soil good. But it is not a soil that will endure a succession of exhausting crops. It is a warm, willing soil, but one that will need moderation in corn and wheat-cropping, and care and skill in husbanding its natural resources, in order to make it permanently useful to the agricul= =turist. And this remark is especially applica= =ble to the whole of this Indian tract of coun= =try; that is, the cultivable portions of it. In the town now under condideration, there is a deficien= =cy in streams of living water, Spring Lake being almost the only condiderable body of water, Town 18 North, Range 11 East, 4th Meridian that has an outlet. White River passes through two or three of the South west Sections of this township, and Willow Creek through the N.E part, increases as this land is near its bend to the East by a small brook which is the natural outlet to Menominee John''s Lake, situated in the township next north, and which runs an easterly course through four or five of the sections in the north tier. The land about Spring Lake, in the S.E. part of the Township abounds in springs of pure sweet water; but the character of the surface around it is such as to render it dangerous of approach to cattle and horses, as also are some of the marshes north east illegible. It is supposed that the other lakes in this township are sustained by subterraneous springs, since there is no traceable inlet; and yet, evaporation, taking one year with another, does not diminish the quantity of water contained in them. Some of these lakes seem to be subject to a pe= =riodical retrocepion of their waters. I have had occasion to remark in the course of the present autumn, between the first of September and November a Subsidence in waters of Hill''s Lake, to the mount of at least 2 ft. in per= pendicular height. Within the past year, a narrow ditch has been cut from the South side of Fish Lake to the north margin of Wolf Lake, at a point where the two lakes approach each other within 1 1/2 chains, since which, there has been a constant flow of water from Fish into Wolf Lake, without as yet affecting an equilibrium. Both are large lakes and deep in the middle, but shallow in most places near the shore; & contain a variety of Fish. This township is fast recieving accessions to its population by im= =migration, and the settlers are of an industrious and enterprising class. In this township there is no grist-mill as yet, but there is one being now built,(Dakin''s) near the South west corner, on White River, in the town next south. There is one saw-mill on Willow Creek in the N.E. Section; Shumway''s mill, which has made a great deal of pine lumber is situated in the Township next west.- There is a valuable quarry of granite in the East half of the south= -west quarter of section 27. In short, this Township is decidedly better than the average of those townships in the Indian country which I have either surveyed or seen; and many good claims, of am= =ple dimensions for farming, may yet be made within its limits.'),

The Limestone ridge runs thro'' it and appears to have been the former barrier of the Lake. The fall from the top of the Lime stone Ledge or upper level to the ground below and nearly on a level with the lake varies from 20 to 50 or 60 feet. This Ledge stretches from the North East and probably preserves its parallelism with the Lake to near its outlet (the Fox River) to the south and west of this township it becomes circular, winding to the west and apparently turns the southern extremity of the Lake. If the Ledge continue around the Lake to near the entrance of Fox River, the inferense is not unreasonable (perhaps) that the Lake rests in a bason of the Rock and formerly extended up to the ledge. From the features of the country within my limited observation, I am led to conjecture that it is this same ledge of Lime rock that ranges the direction of the Wisconsin and fox Rivers at the portage and is the southern and eastern barrier to the latter Rides to its inlet into the Winnebago lake thense winding round the lake it again gives direction to the River toward greenBay. As this is but conjecture, perhaps, these remarks had been better omitted. Under the Ledge, there is very fine timber and a soil as rich as any other in this country. On the upper level, the timber is soomewhat deficient in quantity and growth. Some of the prairie is rather wet, but will make fine Meadow.

('41620','Character history &c of the reported Sheboyagan Lakie I can say but little concern ing the history of this part of illegibletion. In accordance with spe cified Instructions I spent three entire days in examining the margin, and going directly through the reported Lake: in order to ascertain and determine whether \"an island \" existed therein. The inhabitants resi dent in the neighborhood,(there are several families) assured me there was an island. I took one of them, a Mr. Odell, with me: he pointed out a piece of high ground, of some hundred acres, in Section 25. This tract, being surrounded by swamp, illegible a illegible of the illegible Marsh, is called \"the island\". This tract is well within the so called Lake; Section 25 having been sur veyed by Mr King, and not ac turned with official Plot as any part of the Lake. I found, after care =ful examination, no insur mountable, nor common ob =stacle to a continuous survey, except the Pond, in Section 14,23 & 24. A man may walk over any part of this Marsh,(Lake at any season of the year,(unless it be just when the ice is making a leaving) though in what is called high water, we would be in illegible, by walking perhaps midleg deep. No important percievable changes have been affected by illegible within the last 15 years, nor indeed for a much longer period.- Evidences are abundant to the eye, that the generaly, relative illegible of water and earth, are about the same they were at the date of the afforsaid survey. A sufficient reason for its having been left as it was, in the month of April, is referable to the fact doubtless, that at that moment, the ice was just breaking up, rendering the Pond, river as well as the marsh inpassable. The observor, at first would say \"it has at some former period all been a Lake\". But if indeed it ever was so, it must have been at some very remote, for =mer period. It is all one illegible tract; a rise of water on one part is equally so on the whole: the tam erack timber though small, is old at least 70 to 100 years. The mud on this marsh, under the bog , is several feet deep, without hard bottom: the lower deposit is of a fine whitish earth, without sand or grit resembling starch, to a depth of 10 feet or more: in fact, we did not with a 15 foot pole find hard bottom. The margin of the marsh and swamp is of a uniform char =acter, Cedar at the edge near the hard land, say for 3 or 4 chains, there tamerack of a common size, which are smaller as we go toward the open Marsh, till they are not more than 4 feet high. The Marsh has a short Coarse grass, some times cut by the settlers for hay tho of a poor quality:- the surrounding hard land, is excedingly rich fertile & Beautiful; especially on the south side. On the N. and W. it is somewhat stony and uneven. The Sheboyagan Rover is a fine stream, 2 chs wide, 14 feet deep, of a gentle current per fectly navigable for Boats, the whole width of the township except where it passes through the Pond: in this the navigation would be interrupted by the \"floating island\", which covers the N 1/2 of the Pond, and at both the inlet and outlet of the River. This Marsh extending East =ward & near the Range line, About 5 chains West of the range line, commences a slight rapid, once a loose,pebly bottom, which continues for a 1/2 mile: This rapid might be cut down;-illegible some 4 or 5 feet, at a slight expense, by illegible means the Marsh illegible be drained and all made dry land.'),

('41623','From the location of this township it will, I think, possess advantages over every other place on the western shore of the Lake (two or three excepted.) The River is larger than Chicago-nearly of the same bigness as Milwaukeeand what distinguishes it from the latter river, is that there is no Marsh about its Mouth. The banks are sufficiently elevated and dry-affording a beautiful site for a Town. From appearances here was, at a period gone by, a large Indian town. It is now reduced to a few Wigwams. The River is well stored with fish illegible -- Passing up it at the distance of half a mile the bottom land begins and extends up it, on each side, about two miles-varying in width from 50 to 100 rods. Here the Indians cultivate and grow a considerable quantity of Indian corn, potatoes ect. The soil is of the first quality. Farther up, the river becomes of less debth and is rapid. I have Meandered it to the west line of the township. From its magnitude I judged it so far Navigable. This is but a little below the Falls in the next township. There is considerable White pine timber, greatest in quantity, near the River. The most of it is large and very fine. The Saw-Mill, built on Section 28 ( noticed in the Field-book) is in opperation and doing good business.- It now is producing and will continue to produce a considerable destruction of the valuable timber in its vicinity. The Sugar trees abound in great abundance. The Indians manufacture Sugar, from them, in considerable quantity. December 15th. 1835 From the mouth of this River an important intercourse with the south end of Lake Winnebago and to the west of that place will be established at no very distant day. The ground is favourable for building a road. At that place (the Fout Du Lac) it will intersect with the road from Millwakee Green Bay and the Protage between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. The climate is fine and to all appearances, healthy. No country that I have ever seen, is better supplied with Water; and Water power applicable to all the purposes of supplying human wants, is found at short distances; both on the Shabowaegan and Meeme. The Meeme is sufficiently large for Mills and affords good Sites March 1st 1835'),
