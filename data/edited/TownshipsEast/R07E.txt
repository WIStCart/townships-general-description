A General description of this town

The appearance of the Town is

Township 13 North Range 7 East 4 Meridian
swampy and marshy- The large
Tamarac Swamp will prevent
the settlement and improvement of a
large tract- The swamp in many 
places is merely floating turf and
scarce affords support for man -
In the West and North West part
the Sand is more valuable and 
more extensively cultivated -consisting
mostly of Oak openings- The illegible
flat or prairie near the river is 
well adapted for grasses and
grazing -and of easy access--
The improvements of the Town are 
illegible few and those generally
of temporary character, The whole
number of Homes is about 20
and the number of acres improved
about 375 the character of these 
improvements are on the whole quite
temporary and unsubstantial

almost entirely of Tamerack & alder Swamps
& Wet Marshy, entirely worthless totally unfit
for cultivation. The Western part is Pine
Barrens. the Soil a poor white Sand, The timber
Pitch Pines from 6 to 12 inches diameter & not
of any value for lumbering purposes. There
are a few cranberries in Some of the marshy
but not enough to give any value to the land
On the whole, it may be said that the whole township
is nearly worthless either for Soil or timber-
