the hills and the valleys are
alike well adapted to agricultural
purposes and the greatest ob-
struction to Settlement is the
heave timber,-which is of
excellent quality, consisting
principally of Oak and Sugar.
	Sections 1 and 2 are in
the valley of the Lemonwier
river , a Country Second to none

there are already Some illegible

East corner of the Township

wet are yet susceptible of 
a high degree of cultivation , but

them. Seven mile creek receives its
name from its distance from Manghis
mill on the Lemonwier, meaning 
from the point where it crosses the road.
	The progressive tendencies
of our population are 
no where more clearly exhibit-
ed than in this Township,-houses
& improvements arising as it were
by magic where a few months 
aince was but a wild waste.

T15NR4E
 In the Southern & Western parts of this
Township the soil is mud with a slight
mixture of sand, & is well adapted to agri-
cultural purposes. The soil of the 

remaining portions, though sandy, is neverthe-
less generally good & and in many localities ex-
cellent. The marshes afford an abundance
of the best of grass-and the timber though
small is of good quality. many farms are
opened & being opened in the South & West;
and in the N.W. around Manghis mill on
the Lemonwier there is quite a thriving settle-
ment. In the S.E. is Sheep-pasture 
Bluff, which rises high above the surround-
ing country & is visible for miles.

Three or four farms have been 
opened near Kingsbury's Ferry in Sec.

ship lying East of the Wisconsin
river. Roads are laid out from
the Ferry to the main Portage City
road & the Marsh House on the 
East & the Yellow river mills
on the West side of the river;and
it bids favor to be, at some day,
of considerable value. Quincy is
the name that Mr. Kingsbury pro-
poses to give to the settlement 
near his landing. 
	West of the Wisconsin this Town-
ship consists almost entirely of swamps
& marshes, interspersed with worth-
less Black Pine knolls. It is value
less - unless for the culture 

of cranberries and grass - and 
contains no improvements of 
any description.
   The timber is principally Black
Pine & Jack Oak of inferior 
quality.

Township 17 North, Range 4 East 4th Meridian.
 Little can be said in favor 
of this Township. With the ex-
ception of that part lying 
East of the Wisconsin river,
and sections 1,2,11 & 12, where
the soil is of a good though 
not of the best quality, its
soil is generally too poor 
and sandy for cultivation
and its timber, consisting
mostly of Black Pine and Oak,
too inferior to have any
marketable value. The most 
valuable parts of the Township
are the marshes where grass
of good quality can be procured
& cultivated.
There are improvements
upon only three Sections, viz,

1, 12 and 36 and those are
of too recent a date to
have tested thoroughly the
qualities & capabilities of
the soil.

very poor.   the streams are fed 
by the swamps and are subject 
to very sudden rise & fall

distance. The Surface
is so level that in
many places, it is 
difficult to ascertain
which way the water
really runs. There is
some upland which
may be cultivated,

of the soil is 3rd rate.

 General Description of
Township  37 North Range 4 East
   The quality of the land 
in this Township is 
rather below the
common average, being
mostly a white sand
with a heavy coating
of moss Too wet 
for farming purposes.
   Willow River is a
crooked muddy Stream
with low marsh banks
in most places: not fit
for navigation. The
lakes on the north side
of the Township are
merely shallow ponds
in dry seasons but
in wet seasons they 
overflow the surrounding
country for more than
a mile.

Timber chiefly Hemlock
Cedar Tamarac & Spruce.
Some pine in Sections
14 & 22 but of an inferior
quality.
     There is very little
stone in the Township
no regualar layers or 
stratas, only loose
boulders & soft, sand rock.

T38NR4E
	General Description
This township is gently rolling
surface with the poorest or 
3rd rate soil  of a clean light 
sand and in most places 
very stony. Altho they do not
appear at first sight numerous
when the leaves and moss
are burned off it looks as 
if the surface was all rock
filled in with pine Silicia
on sand. The seasons are
too late and short and soil
too poor to even make the
raising of arable or cereal crops
profitable. For grazing purposes
I think it will be valuable.
The springs are late but when 
they do come  herbage seems
to spring into existence as
if by magic owing to the 
sandy nature of the soil.
The rivers and creek bottoms
and in fact every alluvium
deposit unencumbered by

Timber produce and immense
growth of "Bluegrass " " Green
Meadow grass " or "June grass "
the Propratensis Botanists.
I think 4 or 5 tons per acre
only about an average yield
and dry hay is equal to 
timothy for Bovine Stock.
There are a great variety of
timber in the Township.
The conifers predominating
amongst which are the Abris (em-
bracing the Larise Spruce Fir
and Canaderisis) The Pinus
( embracing the White, Black and
Yellow ) and arbor vitae. These 
with one exception are ever-
greens.
     The deciduous trees are
represented by the Albabetula
of the White Black and Water
varieties the former is the
kind the Indians use for
covering the frame of their

canoes. The genus acer
is represented by the acir
Saccparina -- the White and
Spotted the latter nothing more
than an undershrub but 
causes the surveyor more
annoyance than any other 
tree in this country on account 
of its dense foliage.
