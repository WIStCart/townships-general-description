    General Remarks
 This small Fraction of of very
good soil & Timber thoroughly
watered by Pike R & Cr. ;  is occupied
by the Western Emigration Co. who have
made Extensive improvements & illegible
making a harbour at the mouths
of Either River at the Expense of 
their Co.
    There is sufficient depth of 
water at Either River to float the 
largest crafts of the Lakes. - but
insufficient current to open or
preserve a channel
    The width of the channel in the 
Bay illegible appears greater than in the 
River - the former I meandered with
the slack water of the Creek as far
up as I thought would be useful
as a basin: the latter I did not

although, perhaps quite as important
the Bay illegible is generally held in the
highest Estimation.
     The Anchorage is Excellent
off Either place.
   The Island is supposed to
be formed by an ancient bend
of Pike River which by the 
Action of the waves has been
formed into the Present mouth
of that River :  there can be
but little doubt that such
is the fact

       General Remarks
The timber part of this Township is
Excellent - soil 1at rate gravelly,
well watered by prin lime gravelled
surface elevated level.-
     Almost Every Variety of hard Timber
suitable for sawing Hewing or fencing abounds
        Root River is rapid, lime bedded
Stream - watering a first rate country; falls
cuts slack water just above the South boun
dry of Section 8. when the depth is 3 feet
but becomes much deeper a short
distance below  (see meanders)
      The depth of this stream within
the bar at at the mouth is from 12 to 14 feet
& slacks in nothing that I can perceive
for the construction of a good harbour
at comparatively small expense.
     Opposite the mouth, at the distance 
of 3 miles there is said to be a shelf of
rocks - running nearly parrallel
with the shore about two miles in
from 1 to 2 fathom water

but it is not considered an obstruction
to navigation after a light house
shall have been erected.
    On the long Cape in Township
1 & 4  there is an Excellent quarry
of Lime Rock very convenient to the 
lake and about 4 miles from the 
mouth of this River:  the quarter Sec
on which it is situated is claimed
and will undoubtedly be purchased at
the minimum price.-
     Government could avoid paying
this claiment thousands, for that
which she almost donates him, by 
preserving the Stone for Public works.
   This is the only Extensive quarry
any where  in the Vicinity. - will require
no land carriages
  Every inch of this fraction is under
Sqatters claims, there are two good
saw mills in section six   there is on the 
River 25 or 30 illegible fall in the Township

From the location of this township
it will, I think, possess advantages
over every other place on the 
western shore of the Lake (two
or three excepted.) The River is 
larger than Chicago-nearly of 
the same bigness as Milwaukee 
-and what distinguishes it from
the latter river, is that there is 
no Marsh about its Mouth.
The banks are sufficiently elevated 
and dry-affording a beautiful
site for a Town. From appearances
here was, at a period gone by, a large
Indian town. It is now reduced to 
a few Wigwams.
      The River is well stored
with fish illegible -- Passing up
it at the distance of half a mile 
the bottom land begins and

extends up it, on each side,
about two miles-varying
in width from 50 to 100 rods.
Here the Indians cultivate and 
grow a considerable quantity of 
Indian corn, potatoes ect.
   The soil is of the first quality.
Farther up, the river becomes
of less debth  and is rapid.
    I have Meandered it to the
west    line of the township.
From its magnitude I judged
it so far Navigable. This is but
a little below the Falls in
the next township.
   There is considerable 
White pine timber, greatest in
quantity, near the River.
The most of it is large and very 
fine. The Saw-Mill, built

on Section 28 ( noticed in the 
Field-book) is in opperation
and doing good business.- It
now is producing and will continue to 
produce a considerable destruction
of the valuable timber in its
vicinity.
     The Sugar trees abound
in great abundance. The Indians
manufacture Sugar, from
them, in considerable quantity.

   From the mouth of this River an im-
portant intercourse with
the south end of Lake Winnebago
and to the west of that place will
be established at no very distant
day. The ground is favourable
for building a road. At that place

(the Fout Du Lac) it will intersect
with the road from Millwakee
Green Bay and the Protage
between the Fox and Wisconsin
Rivers. 
        The climate is fine
and to all appearances, healthy.
No country that I have ever
seen, is better supplied with 
Water; and Water power appli-
cable to all the purposes of 
supplying human wants,
is found at short distances;
both on the Shabowaegan
and Meeme. The Meeme 
is sufficiently large for Mills
and affords good Sites

of the Township & River in General.
   South of the River, the Land except 
"large thicket", is generally good 2d rate.
   The thicket is mostly wet, and suppo
sed to lie on large flat rock.
     North of the river, is good 2d, and of
ten first rate, rolling, gravelly, well tim
bered Land. The Stream is almost
one continuous Rapid (or swift water) thro'
the Township.   The 2d bank, is gener
ally higher, say 50 to 100 feet, bounding
a vally of   20 chains in width.
First bank, from 8 to 20 feet, of grav
el & lime stone rock; and the River is
usually confined within them, in high
as well as low water. This makes the 
stream one of the best in the Territory for hydro
lics. It affords water sufficient at all
times; and from its rapid Continuous fall,
Dams may be had at good Sites, every
few Chains. It runs over a bed
of solid Lime stone; banks Sand.
 Groves of good pine timber,
in heavy illegible Section, which will doubt
less cause great quantities of lumber to be 

made on this River.
 The Stream is generally 100 to 120 links wide
in illegible, Spring and fall something more; tho'
from the heighets of the 1st bank, it illegible
illegible, even in high water, but a small
width, and must run off with great
illegible. This remark holds only in re
lation to this Township, & a part (the
E part) of the one west of it: for about
the middle of Range 22, it becomes dead,
sluggish & muddy (except at 2 rapids,
where it pass over Ledges & Rock) ex
pands to a great width,    and is
deep and illegible navigable, to the 
west boundary of Range 20. In both
the Ranges 20 & 21 the water spreads
in a Kind of Marsh & swamp, over
a great area; but the stream
itself, is also wide and deep; dur
ing the wet Season, it rises to a great
height, as we percieved by its marks
on the timber  in those bottoms or
swamps.
    The Navigation of this Stream might
be improved from its Mouth to the west

boundary of Range 20 by illegible of the "Slack Wa
ter" System, at a comparitive Small illegible
illegible by removing flood wood, & other slight obstruc
tions, 2 1/2 miles farther (N. Branch) in Range 19;
thence to the N.E. Corner of Winnebego Lake,
a distance of about      miles, the ground
is nearly level, and well adapted to the con
truction of a Rail Road, which would com
plete an inland Navigation, & commica
tion, from Lake Michigan to Lake Win
nebago !

  Nearly the whole of this Township may 
be rated a  1st rate.  Beech & Maple
timber, prevail.- The face of the
Country is gently undulating- a toler
ably good Mill Site may be found
in "Sec 2." also one in "Sec 30."-
   On the whole it will be ranked as
a illegible the but portion 
memonee purchase

T21NR23E
	Remarks
   The larger part of this Township
is fine rolling land of good 2d &
1st rate Soil =   Timber with Beech
Sugar Elm & Bass - sufficiently 
watered by both brances Twin Rs.
& their tributaries.- There are several
fine springs on the West branch which
from the purity of the water appears to
be supplied principally from springs
    it is also favorable for Mill sites
in many places.-
	Mauvais Creek from the Center
of the Township, North, seems to have
its course through what was once
a lake, now a Tamarack & Cedar
Swamp with occasional Black Alder
and W Maple bottoms Next the Creek
which has an almost bottomless bed

    Wherever there is dry land in
this Township , it is sandy
Timbered with Bastard Pine White
& Yellow Pine & aspen & Birch
   The Marshes are verry wet and
almost impassable- have apparently 
been once a part of the Bay
the sections 19.20. & 21 the beach
is turf, with a little sand thrown
upon it by the waves    The river has
no banks in Sections  11 14 13 15
& 23.  but flows all over the Marsh
and my only guide in Meandering
was to wade as deep as I could

 In sections 6.7. & 18 there is 
or has been some good pine timber
With this exception the township 
is thinly timbered. the soil is 
sandy.   All that can be of 
value in this Township are the 
Mill Sites.  On the Peshtego and 
Menomonie Rivers  At both of 
which places valuable mills are 
now in operation. There is a
species of Bastard Pine growing here
partaking of a character of Spruce & 
Pine  which I have never seen growing 
elsewhere. It is of no value being
small & scrubby   Another good
Mill Site might be obtained

in Section 1 above the present
