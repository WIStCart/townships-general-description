 This Township is much cut up by marshes
and swamps. Marsh and swamp
bear a large proportion
to the dry land, and
more than half 
of the marsh is waste and irreclamable land.
There are however, many good farms begun
and more claims may yet be made that 
shall well reward the enterprising pioneer.
The township is favorably situated for comm=
=ication with other parts of the country,[from
its proximity to the Fox River][and for the exporta=
tion of its produce]. The soil is of a sandy forma
=tion, warm and easy to work, readily absorbing
moisture, and decaying animal and vegetable
matter. There is a considerable proportion of soft,
quaking dangerous marsh. This sort of marsh
seems to be an abyss of soft mud, overgrown with 
illegible, which is easily penetrated, and which has been
sounded with poles, to a depth of 12 and 15 feet,
without reaching hard bottom. The good soil of 
the township, thus far, has fallen into good hands.
 The cultivators are a frugal, hardy and industrious

class of people. A considerable part are Irish,
and there are Some fifteen Welsh families, lo=
cated mostly in the southern part of the town=
=Ship. There is no considerable stream of water
passing directly through the township; the Makem
runs through the North East section, & drains Ir=
=win's Saw-mill. The waters of Duck Creek, a 
tributary of the Montello, which passes near the
South west corner of the township also propel a Saw=
mill. Some of te hills contain stone; which,
however, so far as our observation extends, is of
a Sandy formation, and brittle, aften soft, character,
and therefore of no peculiar value for architec
=tural purposes.

  The settlement of this Town by American citizens
was begun in Feburary, 1854. Early in October of the present
year, it received an accession of Several families of Eur=
opean Emigrants; and now contains some 70 or 80 fam=
=ilies.  It is in general speaking in an economical point
of view a poor township of land, So far as soil is 
concerned ; but has some Small districts of good land
It also contains two or three water mill powers, which
are not yet occupied. The State of agricultural im=
=provement is not yet much advanced beyond Irish fancy
and the radish sheds and log-houses. There is a lack
of agricultural implements, bins & other out-houses
necessary to the preservation of crops & the proportion of
grain for the market. The face of the country is little
diversified by hill & valley, though it is traversed from
N W. to S.E by the Makem River or Creek - popularly
Indian word Nahmakem. Almost the only variety of
the Lakes,(Crystal Lake, and Turtle Lake), and one or two
Stone hills , is that of marsh,(of which there are several
qualities ) and timber, which generally oak, & pine, or
Tamarack.-

there is very little arable land
in the Township and as yet
contains no Settlers. The East-

good Soil. Where the Land
is at all adapted to cultivation
the Soil is first rate. It con-
-tains Several small Lakes or
ponds, and one small creek

Township 25 North Range 10 East, 4th Miridian
	General Description.
 This Towship consists of heavily timbered
land, a considerable part of it wet and
swampy. What is dry, is in general by no means
first rate soil. The swamps are chiefly cedar, inter
=spersed , however, with tamarac, spruce and ash.
Hemlock, though very common, is the product of
soil that is more free from water. The propor=
=tion of hemlock increases as you advance toward
the north part of the Township. Open marshes
are comparatively few, and of inconsiderable ex=
=tent. The surface is nowhere very abrupt or
precipitous, but generally rolling or level: and
the hills are not high. A large part of the flat
surface is wet and unfit for cultivation: and a
portion of that which is dry inclines to be sandy
and unproductive. Of the several Kinds of illegible
trees indigenous to this region, the species most
numerously represented are the hemlock, the cedar
the pine, birch, maple, poplar, tamarac, lind
and Oak: to which may be added ironwood

Township 25 North of Range 10 East of 4th Principal Meridian
ash, elm and spruce. The black and white wal=
nut are but rarely met with, and the hickory
still more rarely. A thick growth of young poplars,
is generally indicative of the illegible class of soils.
Under the head of Undergrowth, it may be remark=
=ed, that ground-pine, wintergreen, Prince's pine &
squaw vine grow every where in this region. The
latter, it is said, is commonly illegible by the Indian
women, for the purpose of rendering illegible
illegible. There is one lake of considerable extent
in the Southeast part of this Township, occupy=
=ing a part of sections 23 24, 25 and 26, and
another in the northeast part of the township
being wholly contained within section 3: and
there is a good mill-site upon the stream
which flows therefrom. There are several lakes
in the Township besides these, but none else so
large. The rock found here is mostly granite:
limestone has not been noticed. The princi=
pal river, or creek is the Little Wolf with its

Township 25 North of Range 10 East of 4th Principal Meridian
tributaries, traversing the Township form the North
=west towards the southeast, after affording abundance
of sweet water, and carrying off rapidly the 
superfluous moisture of the swamps and marsh
=es. This Township still remains in its primitive
condition, in regard to cultivation. A single
tree or two, felled years ago for the purpose of
dislodging game, and one sugar orchard
bear almost the only traces of man's labor or
enterprise, that have come under our observa=
tion. The present Contractor has, however, at illegible
expense of time and money, opened a road, 
which a loaded team may pass, from the Wa=
=paca and Stevens Point road, northwardly, through
Towns 24 and 25 range 10, and thence northeast into
the middle of Town 26 Range 11, and Illegible
to the middle of Town 26 Range 10, which
will undoubtedly do much to facilitate the
early settlement of this wilderness.-

T26NR10E
Township 26 North, Range 10 East, 4th Princip Meridian
	General description
There is in this Township a remarkable degree
of uniformity in respect of surface soil and 
productions. The surface is not broken by precipi=
=tous declivities, not indented with deep valleys, but
is in general undulating or rolling. A part of the 
surface is hilly, and a small proportion also of the
dry land is level; but pine plains, in the proper
sense of that phrase, are not to be found in this town=
ship. The soil is neither very sandy, nor very
stoney,-that is, with slight exceptions: nor is much
what would be called of first rate quality, but rather
of the middle soils, between the extremes of very good
and exceedingly poor. Nearly the whole surface of 
the Township is well covered with timber, hemlock
being in the largest proportion on the upland, cedar
in swamp, and tamarac in marshes. The birch,
especially the yellow variety, the sugar maple, the
red oak, and lind are all well represented
in the forest here. The Township is abudantly
watered by springs and living streams, the creeks

Township 26 North of Range 10 East of 4th Princip Meridian
generally flowing form the northeast towards the S.E
there are few open marshes without trees of any Kind
but several tamarac marshes and cedar swamps,
some of considerale extent. There are few haymarshes
most of the marshes being irreclaimable and wholly
unfit for cultivation. The larger lakes are chiefly to 
be found within the central meridian section lines.
but none of great magnitude. the creeks do not in
general flow very swiftly, nor fall abruptly, nor are
their banks high enough to form a good head, so that there
is an unusual destitution of mill-sites. The windfall
near the center of the township dates many years back
it is of only a few chains width, and its course which is
N.E. and S.W. does not seem to have wavered more than
three of the meridian section lines. There are no houses
within the limits of the township, no traces of human
skill or industry or enterprise, except the decayed re
=mains of some hunters' falls or traps for taking game
The nearest approach to works of art are the embark
=ments of two or three ancient beaver dams, which will
not be obliterated so soon as many of the works 
of man's device.-
