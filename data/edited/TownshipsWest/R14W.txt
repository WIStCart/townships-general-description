Sections 1,12, and 13 of this 
Township are flat and marshy
overspread with the water from
Beef Slough
From the numerous old stumps and dead trunks of 
trees still standing, it is evident 
it was once, perhaps before the
formation of Beef Sough
covered with a forest of 
trees simalar to that ad-
joining it on the West
Sections 2,3,10,11 and part
of 4 are thickly timbered, the 
soil more dry and surface
not so flat as that last
mentioned
That part lying west of 
Chippewa River is also
very flat and generally poor
soil
Beef Slough is here entirely
lost in small Slooughs, marshes 
ponds, pointing in every 
direction, some with gentle 
currents and some Stagnant.
There are at present two 
family residences with the 
Township, one a Post office 
called "Nelson and Gillberts
Landing" store and tavern
the other is a woodcutters lodge 
the particular locations
of which are given in the prece-
ding field notes.

T23NR14W
There is a portion of this Township 
lying chiefly in sections 7,8,17,18,19,20
29 and 30 which is susceptible of settlement 
and cultivation and being mostly in the val
ley of Roaring Creek.  The soil in this val
ley is good - there are delightful springs of 
pure water issuing from varoious places
and forming the main stream which con-
tains the trout, a fish which is only 
found in the purest water.
There are three family residences 
in this valley, the locations of 2 of 
which have been given in the notes
the other is near the centre of section 19
without any other improvemients
There is a field of about 10 acres 
on the South West quarter of Section
17
The house in Sec 25 referred to in the
notes is only a temporary kind of lodge 
occupied by Mr. McCain, for the purpose 
of collecting the logs which sxcape from 
Chippewa River through Beef Slough 
and manufacturing them into shingles/
The whole North West part of the Townhip
except that part before described is very rough
and broken and in places very thinly 
timbered, though there is generally 
good white oak timber on the ridges.
The prarie in the South West part of the 
Township is dry and sandy and can scarece-
ly be called second rate, but its surface 
is very handsome.
The East part of the Township is literally 
cut up with sloughs and covered with ponds 
and marshes, only a portion of which 
it is presumed can be shown, on a 
diagram of this sixe and with the
means of information in my posi-
tion
Beef Slough forms its head down
to about the center of this Township
rolls swiftly along through pretty
high banks, with a deep channel 
unimpeded by Islands or landforms
and sufficient for the naviga
tion of steamboats, with a little 
raise of water.  But it here loses 
its distinctive attributes of a River
and sinks into the insignificant charac-
ter of sloughs which can only be 
navigated with difficulty by canoe.

T24NR13W
This township has a superabundant supply of water,
none of which can be made very valuable either 
for propellingf machinery or for purposeds of navi-
gation.
Chippewa river is generally very wide, its eastern
bank low and sandy, whilst the hills on the West side
up to the outlet of Dead Lake approach to the river
The current is tolerably swift, the water shallow 
spreading over a wide surface, and being impe-
ded by many small islands and sand bars
thus presenting obstacles to navigation except in 
times of high water, which will continue to 
exist in all probability until the channel 
can be deepened by some artificial means 
Beef Slough is formed by the water escaping from
Chippewa river and gradually cutting for itself 
a channel along near the base of the hills on 
the East side of the river.  It has been caused
by the current of water washing down the
main channel, East of Beef Island, and 
driving against the left bank where meeting with 
sudden resistance has forced for itself another
passage.  This passage or chute as Beef Slough 
may be called has gradually become wider and 
deeper until it would now admit the transit of 
steamboats at almost all seasons of the year, as
far as the Southern boundary of the township,
and for 4 or 5 miles further.  And were it not 
for the causes explained in the notes of the next
Township South of this, it would be regarded as of
immense advantage to the people inhabiting the
upper Chippewa coutry for purposes of naviga-
tion.  As it is however it is a very serious disad-
vantage to the navigation of Chippewa River 
taking out about one third of its water, and 
finally spreading and depositing them in a 
thousand marshes, ponds, and sloughs.
Little Beef Slough is another chute that runs
out of Chippewa River and runs into Beef
Slough.  It is of no material importance, not 
containing half as much water as Beef Slough, 
and not being likely ever to increase in size or
importance beyond what it now is.
Dead Lake is a handsome little body of 
water, it is kept up by springs, its water is 
very cledar and near its outlet it is deep.
There is no probability that it can ever be
drained or that it will dry up.
There is a dense forest of first rate timber lying 
West of Chippewa River and North of Plum creek.
The timber on the River bottom is of but little utility
except for fuel, being chiefly maple, elm, ash.
There are no settlements nor improvements within 
the Township.

T25NR14W
This Township with the exception of sections 25,
26, 35 and 36 is thickly timbered with a forest of tall 
and beautiful timber, chiefly sugartree, Lynn, Oak,
Elm, Aspen, Ironwood, White Walnut, Ash, Maple, Hickory,
Cherry and Birch, - the Sugartree predominating.
On section 1 there is a considerable quantity of Pine,
much of which is now being sawed into lumber, by
a sawmill on the Eau Galle river in this vicinity
The prairie covering about 4 sections is dry, level,
and of unrivaled beauty, contrasting very favorably with
the high timbered lands surrounding it - its soil can 
only be ranked as second rate, although it is sufficient-
ly fertile to produce grain and vegetables abun-
dantly by cultivation.
The body of water or slough mentioned in the 
notes, and called by the settlers "Dead Lake" is with-
out current, but clear and of considerable depth 
in the cetre, seems from its appearance, once
to have been the main channel of Chippewa River.
Its waters contain fish, frogs and turtles, and is
a great resort for wild fowls - it does not look probable
that it will ever dry up, or that it can be drained
The bluffs in the vicinity of the creeks and brooks 
most all contain sandstone of good quality.  
There are no settlers nor improvements within the 
Township as far as my observation has extended.

General Description
This Township is composed partly
of heavy timbered lands and in part 
of strips of country nearly desilite
of timber by not sufficiently so to
be denominated prairie  A large 
portion however is sufficiently clear
to make the opening of farms a 
very easy matter and good timber
is always near and easy of access
The streams are supplied from springs 
and the Bottoms are generally open
and excellent for hay  Pine has
been cut and floated down Hay
river and there are still some groves
of good Pine in the vicinity of this
stream.  The soil in many parts
is of good quality and the Banks of 
the river afford some good locations for farms

T31NR14W
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This Township is the principal
source of a stream (which we suppose
to be Hay River) which will average near 
South boundary of the Township 30 links
in width and four feet deep, and is
formed by the numerous large springs
which are so abundant in this Township.
	The South East portion of the Town
ship is very hilly with but little timber
and covered with a dense undergrowth 
of Briars and Hazle.  The timber is down
and few has passed through it,and it.
	The balance of this Township is
covered with heavy timber, and has a 
first rate soil.

T32NR14W

This Township is heavily timbered 
with Sugar, white, black, and Bur Oak
and a luxuriant undergrowth of ground tress.
There is a good eal of White Pine scat
tered among the hard timber and a part 
of it is of a first rate quality, particul
=arly that in the south halof of the town
=ship: that in the NOrth halof is more 
scrubby.  The soil in the South half of 
this Township is good, the North is
spongy and very poor.
	In the S. W.
corner of this Township I find 
magnetic attraction, caused by iron 
and rock imgregnated with iron.

T33NR14W
GENERAL DESCRIPTION	
This Township contains many small
swamps; most of which when cleared 
will make good meadow land.
The general surface of the Township
is low and wet, but little first

been heavily timbered with White Pine, but
not a pine tree left standing.  The surface is
gnerally level, the soil first rate, second rate.
The south 1/2 of the township is densly 
timbered with Sugar, White and Burr 
Oak, Lind, Birch, and Ironwood.

T41NR14W
General Description
This Township is notable for its
great number of Lakes and ponds
with their high banks, smooth 
sandy beach, and clean deep
water;  Some of he larger Lakes
are skirted with good Yellow
Pine timber, which will, at no
distant day be valuable for
lumbering purposes:  The Nam.
ekagon River which flows through 
Section 1 and 2, has some fine
pine timber on its banks; most 
of which will be cut this coming
winter as there are two companies
of logging already in the ground
preparing for the winter opera
-tions.  When the Pine is gone 
the land is almost worthless;
the general surface of the 
land is rolling; the soil
is good 3rd rate; in fact in 
some prtions of the old sta-
tes would be called first
rate; the timber, except around 
the Lakes is small Black Pine
that is of but little value for
any purpose.

T42NR14W
General Description
That portion of this lying
East of the St. Croix River has
a level surface, light sandy
soil and thinly timbered with
Black Pine; that portion
which lays West of the River
is heavily timbered with 
good White Pine; It is mostly
claimed by a company who have
been logging on it and are
preparing to carry on heavy oper=
=ations the coming winter;
The same company have built a
substantial Dam across the St.
Croix River in Section 9 for the
pupose of Raising the water to
drive out logs.

T47NR14W
General Description
This Township has a
clay soil the small
streams are all muddy
and go nearly dry in summer.
A copper bearing trap layer
extrudes through the middle of 
Township.  On the south side 
of these hills it is well timbered
with valuable Pine Cedar
Sugar and Black Oak.  Copper 
has been obtained on the SE 1/4
of Section 21and upon sections 
14+15 The streams (illegible)
into Black River are all very rapid.

T48NR14W
General Description
This Township is timbered pricipally 
with Tamarac, Spruce and Fir.
The soil is a tough clay of a brick-red 
color, which imparts its hue to all
the streams.  The surface is generally 
undulating, but much of the land is
flat and wet, being adapted only to the
growing of grass.  Left Hand River is 
a deep and very crooked stream from 
4 to 8 rods in width, with a gentle, and
in the NE part of the Township, a 
sluggish current.  It is navigable
through several miles of its course for
wessels of considerable size, and
for keel-boats nearly to the South
boundary of the Township.  Its banks 
are high and the 'Bottoms' very rich,
being composed of afine alluvial mix-
ture of sand and clay.  These bottoms are 
mostly heavily timbered with Cedar, Ash,
Elm. and are subject to inundation
to depths of from three to ten feet.
The NE quarter of section 14 has been 
improved and claimed.

red clay adapted to the
raising of grass (illegible) wet
for the cultivation of grains.
Its locality in a 
commercial point of view 
second to very few 
in the United States and 
to none in the North
West.  It is surrounded
by an fine Biay of a Mile
and a half in width 
with a depth of water
sufficient to accomadate 
shipping of the largest 
class that sails the Lake
with scenery unsurpassed 
for beauty by any place on 
the Lake.
A (illiegible) has been laid off
on sections 13+24 and 
preperations are being made for 
to build exlusivley this 
summer the proprietors are 
Mefus, Slaughley, Bronson 
+ others.
