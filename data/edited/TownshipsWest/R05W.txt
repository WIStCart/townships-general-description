The Formation of this Township
is a coarse Silicious Sand Stone
in many Places capped or
overlaid with lime Stone.
The rock has generally but a
shallow covering of either
snad, clay or sandy Loam
The dividing ridge which di
-vides the waters of of the Miss
-issippi from the waters of the
Kicapoo passes through this
Township in a Northeasterly and 
forms a good natural road
through it in that direction
from this ridge there are
other ridges branching off
West to the Mississippi & East
to the Kickapoo. The surface
of the country is very broken
particularly near the stream
the least broken part of the 
township is between the heads
of the streams, which embrace
Sections 8. 9. 10. 14. 15. 16. 17.(?)
20. 21. 22. 27. 28. & 29
the country near the ridge
is watered by springs which
break out in the heads of 
ravines but do not form 
streams on account of the
water sinking again in the 
sand; The water forming the 
streams comes out in large
springs at the foot of the 
high sand stone Bluffs.
The timber is generally of 
an inferior quality with
the exception of a few good
groves on the western side
of the Township

Most of the surface of this Town
ship is extremely broken or Hilly.
The prairie in the S.E. part is
roling 1st rate land, the soil
except on the hill sides is a 
rich sandy Loam the hill
sides are covered with loose
rock & flint this township is 
exceedingly well watered on the 
west by streams runing into the 
Mississippi & on the east by streams
runing into the Kicapoo the di-
-viding ridge between the Miss. &
the Kicapoo passes through the 
township from North to South
from a mile to two miles east of
the centre of it and forms a good
natural road. The rock formation
is a silisious Sand stone. The bluff
of the Creeks, Spring brooks, and 
dry ravines are from 250 to 
350 feet high

The surface of this Township
with the exception of a few sec-

Sections 24 & 25 in the eastern
part is roling first rate land
or good 2nd rate land. The soil
is Sandy Loam, excepting the
Prairie it is thinly timbered

watered by some spring brooks
which run into the Kickapoo.
The S.W. Part of the Township
is very broken; well timbered
& watered by streams of Pure
water which run into the
Mississippi. The rock formation
is a silisious Sand Stone. The 
Dividing Ridge between the 
waters of the Kickapoo & the waters
of the Mississippi passes through
this township in a North & South

	The only 1st rate land in this township
is in the valley of Raccoon Creek_ mostly
prairie bottom, watered by a most beautiful
stream; The upland is estimated at from
250 to 300 feet above this vally, and is near-
ly all of it (except in the timber) covered
with a thick growth of Black or jack Oak
Bur Oak, Aspen & Birch brush  The hill sides
are generally of a slope 50 and 60 degrees
and very rocky, & where these hill terminate
in a point between two streams, the extreme
point generally presents a lofty sandstone
cliff, sometimes bare & bleak_ sometimes
clad in dwarf cedar Hemlock or Bur Oak
	Timber almost universally Black & W.
Oak; some of it very good. Some Elm,
Linden & ash in N.E. corner on Raccoon
Creek.  There are many very fine springs
of pure water, & plenty of deer & grouse

T15NR5W
	General description.
	This Township crosses the high dividing
ridge between the Prairie La Cross river & Mormon
creek on the North and Raccoon Creek and
its tributaries on the South. On the summit
of this ridge there is a good deal of Land
adapted to scccessful cultivation & maybe
termed good second rate; in the East half
of the Township, the timber on it is very
sparse, & there is generally a thick growth of
White, Black & Bur Oak and Aspen brush; on
the West half the timber is not very dense
but of a good quality_ cheifly White &
Black Oak. The remainder and where=
ever there is the smallest stream, is very 
hilly & brushy; with Sandstone on the surface
in many places, valuable for building. At 
the termination of almost every hill there is 
a quarry of sandstone. There are trout in 
all the streams & we have found a great many
deer & grouse.  Indications of Iron ore.
