Township 23 NOrth, Range 13 West, 4th Meridian, Wis.
There is but little attraction in this Township for the farmer, the
manufacturer, or the lumberman, and certainly none for the 
surveyor.  It is literally crowded with hills from East to West.
and from South to North, and those of no ordinary elevation,
many of them rise proudly two or three hundred feet, over-
looking Lake Pepin, Mississdippi and Chippewa Rivers, the
Beef sloughs and a thousand other reservoirs and chan-
nels of water in the adjacent coutry, their surfaces meas-
sure from base to summit from fife to fifteen chains and
many of them are not more than twenty links wide on the 
top.  There is no regularity whatever in the order of
the hills, they rise in every direction, resembling in the
distance, huge ant hills.
The timber is chiefly black oak.
There is no settlement nor improvement within the 
township

T24NR13W
This Township is very hilly, rough, and in many places brushy.
There is a constant succession of hills from the South to the North 
end of the Township, some entirely bare of vegetation or trees, and 
some pretty thickly timbered, chiefly with Black Oak and Aspen,
though generally bare on the South side to the summit, and
brushy or timbered on the North side, or plain accordingly as
to whether there is a sudden descent or level.  All thise hills
which are bare are very rocky, except those in the "Double
Tier" of sections, which are generally sandy.
The whole West side of the Township, and part of the centre
is a loose bed of yellow sand, and very poor.
There are no settlements nor improvements within the
Township.
