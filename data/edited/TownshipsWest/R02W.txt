T2NR2W
General Remarks
The township to which the foregoing
field notes relate, is mostly very
hilly, and thinly timbered with black
white and bur oak. The soil is
nearly all 2nd rate, the only part that
can be called 1st rate is the small
proportion of prairie in the S.E. cor-
ner of the township; and the only portion
that can be called 3rd rate is some small
swamps in the river bottom land.
	The navigability of Platte River depends
almost wholy on the height of the missis-
sippi - sometimes it may in some
places be forded, and at other times
it is navigable for steam boats
up to the Forks, to which place
it is meandered.
	On the river in this township
are two smelting establishments, with
a few houses for the accomadation
of laborers around each, the postion
of which is indicated on the dia-
gram prefixed to these notes.
	The lower establishment, on Section 19,
is owned by Wheller and Hough, and 
the upper one, on Sec.7, by Marshall
Detantebaratz.  The former has a Post
office and bears the imposing European
name, "Gebraltor"_the latter has no Post
office but has taken the still more
imposing name of Paris. Both
however, seem to wear their honors
meekly, and from present apperan
-ces, without the expectation of rival
-ing in size or importance the pla-
ces whose names they bear for 
at least several years to come.
	No mines have yet been discover
ed in this township, and probably
none exist.

Natural Curiosities of 
	This Township_
Barrows' Rock & Cave, is 
Situated in the SW 1/4 of
the SW 1/4 of Sec 18_
A bold & lofty tower of 
Rocks of Sandstone_
	The Examination of this
ledge of Rock was made
by having trailed a large
Bear to his den in this
lofty pinacle.
	It is about 200 feet
above the Creek that skirts
its base_ The ascent to 
the top is somewhat diffi-
cult, being very steep, and 
covered but slightly with 
shrubbery & soil_
upon the top of the
of the first table, or bench
is a solid rock field
up some 25 or 30 feet 
high & about 20 Rods
in length_  There is no
passage to the top of 
this rock Except the
very dangerous one of
climbing up the side
of the Crumbling Sand
Stone_ A passage or
trail has been made
quite around this top
pinacle by Old
Buen(?) the keeper of 
this fort, and in many
places, there are passages
through it_
On the North side is 
the Entrance to the 
Cave, the extent, and 
inhabitants of which
we did not make ourselves
	acquainted with_

General Description
	The general face of the
Country is very broken 
and hilly_ and with
one or two exceptions
there is not level land 
enough in it, to make 
a good farm -
	There is a Ridge of 
good Timberland land occas-
-ionly, but there is no
access can be had to
it without immense
Labour in making Roads.
The Soil in general is 
good_ The timber is 
Mostly, Sugartree, Lynn &
W. Oak_ Sugartree being the
most abundant_ in 
fact it may all be
considered a good Sugar camp
No Undergrowth is found
Except upon the Creek
bottoms_
	It abounds in springs
of pure water, forming
Creeks in every direction.
No Mineral indications
of any importance _

T10NR2W & c
----Second Description----
The surface of the Township
is very Hilly, the soil in the
Eastern part generally is 3rd
rate and in teh Western
part it is 1st and 2nd rate
The Timber is of 1st rate
quality and stands very
thick on the ground it is
of Oak Sugar Maple Lind
Elm Black and White 
Walnut Ash Hickory and 
Ironwood,
Upon examining this Township
I found the lines Hazed
between Sections 35 and 36
25 and 36 and between 24 and 25
I saw no widence of any other
lines

T12NR2W
	     General Description.
	The tops of the ridge notwithstanding thick
great elavation are generally not too rolling 
for Cultivation, and judging from the tim-
ber which is large & very tall & thick & also
from the spruces which are 1st Sugar Maple 
2nd Lynn, 3rd Elm & ash 4th Black, White,
& Bur Oak_ The soil must be very good
but not more than 1 foot deep, with a 
Substratum of yellow clay.
	The bottoms are generally wet & unfit 
for Cultivation with Elm timber & Alder
undergrowth.  There is always a high 
bluff on each side of every stream however
small illegible the draughtsman will find
the highest only noted in the progress of 
the work; These bluffs terminate abruptly
at the confluence of the streams in sand
stone precipices clothed in evergreen,
that look picturesque, but are no small
matters to chain over.
Plenty of Deer, Bear, & Pheasants & water
Streams are all rapid, with good mill seats

T13NR2W
	General Description.
	This Township has a good deal of 
bottom Land on the Kickapoo river, some of 
which, particularly the 2nd bottom or highest
& farthest from the river, is very rich, with 
Bur Oak & Elm timber & Prickly Ash & Red
willow undergrowth; but some of these flats
are too wet for cultivation & may be termed
Alder Swamps.  The South end of the pine
ry reaches 3 miles into this township and 
there are now 25 men engaged in cutting 
Lumber within its limits.  The Pine is all
on or near the river & some of it is very val-
uable.  The Road mentioned in the foregoing
notes leads from Prairie Du Chien to this 
Pinery.  On both sides of the Kickapoo, the 
Land is very broken, and the hills are lofty
terminating in Sandstone Precipices next the river
On the ridges the Land is good & valuable for 
its large Oak & Sugar Maple timber. The Creek 
in the Southern part of the Township is rapid
& affords sufficient water & fall for Machinery
The Current of the Kickapoo is very rapid.
