	General description
This part of this Island is much 
higher than in other places, very little
below high water mark; soil is 1st rate
sandy, & the timber is large & dense
but the rapid current of the Mississippi
cuts away the shore very fast.
Some large Bur Oaks & Birch; Ash, Elm
Maple, Bur Oak & Cottonwood.

T16NR8W
  General description
This Fraction is nearly all subject to 
inundation from the Mississippi to the
depth of from 1 to 6 feet; but there
are bodies of very fine timber near the
shore & some good 2nd rate sandy soil	
  The marshes seem to be the lowest
& are either entirely destitute of timber
or if there is any it is generally killed
by high water.
	In the meanders some sloughs
have been cut of & excluded because
there was so much of it to do & the
Sand was not deemed sufficiently
valuable to justify the meandering
of them all.
	There are a great many Willow
bars in the mississippi S.W. of this 
Township

T17NR8W
General description
The larger portion of this township is low
& marshy or swampy & subject to inunda-
tion to the depth of from 2 to 6 feet.
  There is a strip of high & dry land
however between Black River & a Marsh
on the N.E. about 70 Chains wide & 4
miles long, mostly elevated 20 feet above
high water mark, highest near the river
& containing some smooth 1st rate prairie
and N.E. of said marsh, there is another
strip equally good; but Section 1 is
barren & sandy
      West & S.W. of Black River there is
a great quantity of good timber; but the
soil cannot be made available for tillage
   The "New Channel" of Black River is now
wholly  used for rafting & the "old" is 
drained of nearly half of its water by it
    The little islands noted on the Meanders
of Mississippi are not worth Surveying.
