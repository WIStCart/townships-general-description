	This township is Measurably
unfit for cultivation beeing hilly and
broken. The soil Mostly 3rd rate and
poor in general the timber is of an
inferior growth. Bur. White and Black
Oak. The hills fronting the Rivers
Mississippi and Bad Axe are in many
places Entirely shorn of vegitation. Covered
with rock, flint and Ironrust. It is 
in all parts well supplied with 
springs of the finest quality pure
cold water. The Bottom of Bad Axe
River (altho wider in this Township
than any place else) is limited and 
Mostly low and wet. The Mississippi
River above and below the Mouth of 
Bad Axe has litle or no Bottom
Bounded by a perpindicular lege of Sand
Stone, varying from 3 to 10 chains
from the river, and falling abruptly
from the base of the perpindicular
to the waters edge, covered with
large tumbling rocks and scattering
Bur White and Black Oak trees

T13NR7W
	General description
The whole of these Islands are subject
to innundation to the depth of 2 to 10
feet & the highest ground and best
soil is near the main channel of the 
Mississippi, where the timber in some
places is very large and valuable.
	It will be seen by the accompanying
diagram that the ground included by 
the Mississippi & Coon Slough, is divided
into three Islands by Sloughs which have
been meandered; the most Southern is 
of least value & the other two are well
timbered (except in the Marshes) with
Birch, Maple, Ash, Elm, Bur Oak, Cotton
wood & Willow.
	Coon Slough is not so wide as the main
channel, but is very deep and rapid
& is used as the Steamboat channel.
The other two Sloughs, meandered are deep
and rapid.

T14NR7W
	General description.
The eastern part of this Township is very
broken and in some places sparsely
timbered. White, Black & Bur Oak.
There is some sandy 2nd prairie on
a 2nd bottom between Coon Creek, Mormon 
Slough & the bluffs. The streams are
generally rapid & the water very good
	All that part West of Mormon
Slough, with but rare exceptions is a low
wet 1st bottom, interspersed with flag
marshes of small extent & Subject to 
innundation from 3 to 8 feet; but except
in the marshes the timber is dense and 
valuable_ cheifly Ash, Maple, Birch, Elm,
& Bur Oak.
 	The ground near the Bluffs seems lower
than on the River from the strong current in
Middle & Coon Sloughs & the latter is the 
Steamboat channel, & is also prefered by 
the timbermen to the Main channel.

T15NR7W
	General description
	There are three distinct classes of Land in
this Township Vig: 1st The upland which consists
of high hills nearly bare of timber & terminating
towards the Mississippi abruptly in Sandstone
cliffs- some of them 200 feet high; with many
fine springs in the ravines, which sink in the 
sandy bottom West of them: 2nd The prairie
or 2nd bottom, which is lowest near the bluffs & 
gradually rises with an undulating Surface till
it reaches a Slough which bounds it on the S.W. 
where it is elevated 40 feet above the 1st bottom.
3rd the timbered or 1st bottom, which is only val-
uable for its timber & is subject to innundation to 
the depth of about four feet, & is cut up by 
many small Sloughs & bayous.
	Prairie La Cross possesses a fine
site for a town & may have many advantages from
the Black River Lumber trade.
	Current of mississippi bears towards the 
left bank here, which is generally 8 feet high.

T16NR7W
	General description.
Nearly all of that part S.E. of La Cross
River is very broken, with hills from 200 to 
250 feet high, facing the Mississippi bottom
in Sandstone pricipices, clad with cedar
but the water in the small streams is of 
the purest freestone, and there is some very 
good timber.  The La Cross bottom is 
nearly all an impervious marsh with 
very little timber, & the surface of the 
tide in the River even at low water is in 
many places, level with the banks.
Between La Cross & Black River there is 
some dry 2nd rate prairie & Oak timber & 
a good deal of marsh & swamp; and so
between Black River & the Missippi, but 
the marsh & swamp preponderate.
All the 2nd bottoms are dry, 2nd rate & sandy
with Bur & Black Oak. Some broken
land in N.E. corner; timber White & Black
Oak, with some Bur Oak & Hickory.


T17NR7W
General description.
The Eastern part of this Township
is very hilly, with some groves of 
good timber, cheifly Black Oak and 
White Oak; the soil is only 2nd rate & 
the bottoms on branches are generally 
marshy.  The Second bottom West 
of the hills is dry and sandy, 2nd rate
with a sparse growth of Bur & Black
Oaks.  There is a large Marsh in 
the S. West part which draws off
towards the head of a Lake which 
cuts the South boundary & appears
to have been at some time the bed of 
Black River.  All the First bottom
is rather wet for cultivation, though
in many places the surface lies in 
parallel ridges as if it had once been
cultivated by the Indians.
Very little timber in the West part of 
the Township.

This Township is generally

This Township is valuable
because bordering on Bark Point
Bay which is the only tollerable 
harbour between La Point and
Fondulac. Bark Point is the
principle resort for fishing the busi-
-ness on the upper part of the Lake
and will be immediately purchased
and occupied for the fish packing busi-
ness. For agricultural purposes
it is as good as any in my district
