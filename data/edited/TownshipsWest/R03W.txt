T2NR3W
Fractional T2 N. R 3 W. (N.W. Terry.)
	General Remarks
	The fractional Township herein
before described, is, as will appear by 
the notes, generally very hilly, brushy
and 2nd rate land; and had it not
been for a valuable discvery of lead
one made by us while running the 
north boundary of the township, in the
spring of 1832, it would probably
have remained unnoticed for many 
years to come.
	This discovery was made on 
the town line in the N.E. corner of
section number 2, where the one was
observed in small pieces on the
surface of the ground and lying
in the bed of a small run; and
the prospects of finding it in large
quantitee were considered so flatter-
ing as to attract great numbers of 
persons from all parts of the 
mining district.  The county was
examined for several miles around
and the result has been the discov-
ery of several large and valuable
leads, principally on Sections 2 and
3 in this town, and 34&35 in T. 3 North
of it, and this is now considered
one of the richest and most val-
uable sections of the mining country.
	Along the Mississippi, on the
bottoms, between the bluffs and the
river, there is also considerable
good land for farms.
	Platte River is navigable for
steam boats in an ordinary stage
of the water, but a ban at its
mouth prevents boats from coming
in where the river is low.

Township 9 North Range 3 West 4th Mer
The majority of the foregoing
Township is composed of the first
and second qualities of land.
About half of said Township
is of the first quality a deep 
and amable(?) soil with a sur-
face rolling, but not bro-
ken. This division composes
the larger summits.
	As we approach the stream
on illegible, the surface becomes
more irregular, the soil 
thin, and many portions
are little better than
barrens. In the immidiate
vicinity of the streams the
country is remarkably
rough and broken, the hills high 
and precipitious, and the
rocks at, or near the surface
The whole Township is heavily
timbered, maple and oak
predominating.  Evry section
contains a capital "sugar 
orchard", and some of them
are covered with little else.
The streams, which are all all border
ed with a dense under-
growth, are permanent, and
all studded with moun-
tain trout.  The water is 
clear, cold and soft, run-
ning over pebbly bottoms.
	The rock is principal-
ly a course sandstone, at-
least this is the rock which comes
to the surface and is ob-
servable at the bluffs.

Township No.10 N. Range No.3 W.
The land of this Township
is principally of the 2d. 
quality_ the sur-
face uneven and the soil
shallow. It is valuable
chiefly as a grazing dis-
trict. It's water is excel-
lent and abundant.
	The ridges, which make
up the great majority of 
the Township, are covered
with oak. Lynn and ma-
ple, however, sometimes
occur.
	The beds or valleys of
the streams are covered
with dense undergrowth
	Geology same as in

	Gen. Description
The hilly parts of this
Township composing parts
of sections 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,
12,20,21,22,23,25,31,32,&34 and
all of Sections 26,27,28,35,&36
rise in high broken ridges
and have a sandy unproduc
tive soil.  The same can be 
said of the soil of the bottom
with the exception of those
lying in sections 5,6,7,&8 on the 
west side of Lacross creek which
have a soil of loam & sand
and are tolerable productive
The Timber with very few
exceptions is of an inferior 
quality. Small, and scrubby.
The streams afford abundance
of water but are not rapid
nor have they banks or beds
which would be suitable for
mill sites, being uniformly
sand.

The soil of this Township with the exception
of the small prairie lying in sections 28
29,32,&33 is sandy and unproductive
The timber in the East half of the 
Township and in the North West corner
is almost exclusively Yellow Pine, 
possessing little or no value; that growing
along the ridge of hills that runs through
sections 3,4,9,10,15,16,17,19,20,29 & 30
is good quality of Black and White Oak
The streams flowing from the swamps
all have gentle or sluggish currents, 
and dark colored waters strongly 
structured with Iron
The rapids in Lacross Creek on the 
South West quarter of the north West 
quarter of section 23 will furnish an 
excellent water power
The prairie on sections 28,29,32,&33
has a dark deep soil of sand and loam
and will well pay for cultivation

The hilly lands of this township have
a broken surface, and; an unproductive
soil. The level of bottom lands
are dry and sandy, and have a soil
little superior to the hilly lands
The swamps are valuable for the 
timber they produce being mostly
covered with valuable White and 
Yellow Pine and Tamarac
Valuable groves of black & White

of the hills on sections 6,7,8,&9
The streams flowing from the

This Township embraces
tne most of Shawgawam-

Pine Barren but will
be occupied for
fishing and other purposes
That part of Madaline
Island embraced in this

will be purchased as soon 
as offered for sale.  The 
American Fur Co.'s old works
now occupied by Mr Boyd

are also several other

Mr Boyd also has a field 
of some 20 Acres in this

T50NR3W
General Description
This Township Embra
ces the South West
Ends of Madaline
and Bass Islands
and a small piece
of the mainland
in sections 6&7
The Town of Lapoint
containing some three
hundred inhabitants is 
situated along the Lake
Those in Sections 30&31
Fishing constitutes the chief
Business of the Town and 
there has been as high as
twenty thousand barrels
of fish packed here anually
for shipment. The soil
is a light colored clay
and in places sand and 
will produce tollerably well
by enriching.  The South
Point of Madaline Island
together with the sur-
-rounding high lands
and Long island
make the safest and most
commodious harbours on 
the Lake  This fact will
as the commerce of the Lake
increases give great im-
portance to the Town & vicin
-ity of Lapoint.
A Light house will doubt-
less be wanted in a few years
on the projecting point in 
the North West 1/4 of Section
30 and I would suggest that 
it might be advisable to reserve
it for that purpose

	General Remarks,
     The land in this

rolling and is pretty
well adapted to agricul-
tural persuits, the soil
is gravelly and in some
places stony. The poorest
portions are Wilson's and
Bass Islands, which contain

near the Lake.

General Remarks,
	The principal part
of the land of this

is more level, but it soil
is of a good quality.

Remarks
	The soil of this Township
is of rather poor quality,
yet some crops can be 
raised with tolerable success.
	The timber of these Islands
is quite dense but is of inferior
quality.
	No rocks are found
Except red sandstone of which
the shore is in most places
composed.  The oppor-
tunities for fishing in this 
vicinity are Excellent.
