Township 20 North Range 11 West 4th Meridian
    General Description
 This Township is nearly all rolling and 
very broken. The ridges are from 3 to 5 hundred
feet high and are so narrow in many
places that there is hardly room for a road
The sand and lime rock are abundant 
and show themselves at the points of the 
ridges and along the hill sides and some-
times in high perpendicular bluffs.
There is very little timber but a large
portion is covered with oak bushes and 
aspen thickets. There is not 500 acres in the 
whole Township fit for cultivation and that
is in small detached pieces that it is not
likely to be cultivated for many years
