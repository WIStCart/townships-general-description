This Township lays very high and is broken into
hills and perpendicular bluffs in the vicinity
of the Lake.
It is generally timbered with White Oak and 
Red Oak of good quality.

T24NR16W

This Township is pretty rough and hilly.  The east=
=ern portion is generally thinly timbered with Oak,
Hickory, and Aspen - but in places, there are ridges of
very fine White and Red Oak.
That protion lying West of Rush River is very 
thickly timbered with Sugartree, Lynn, Elm, Oak
and other varieties.
The Shore, almost from one side of the Township 
to the other is very rocky and rough.

T25NR16W

	This Township with the exception of the South East
part is covered with a thick forest of beautiful tim=
=ber.  The Sugartree, Lynn, Oak and Elm predomina=
=ting.  The Pine exists in small bodies, but usually of
good quality.
	Rush River is the most beautiful stream of its 
size that can be concieved, its pure bright silver
waters contain trough in abundance; its rock
bound bed and banks afford easy facilities for
erecting machinery.
	There are as yet no settlements nor improve=
=ments in the Township.

T28NR16W

In the North East part 
of this Township there is 
some very good White 
Pine Timber, the facilities 
for getting it to market 
are so obstructed that it 
will not be valuable soon
The surface is generally 
pretty level; soil mostly
1st Rate; undergrowth
very thick on the west 
side of Township
The Eau Galle ranges 
from 50 to 100 links wide
very rapid current rocky
bed, there is a great num-
ber of sink-holes on the
West sid of the Eau Galle
in which the surface water
sinks or runs away.

T29NR16W

General Description
This Township as a general 
thing is gently rolling in surface
and of a soil well adapted to
the climate being a surface
coat of black mould on 
a sub soil of sand
The Timber particularily in the
Eastern part is heavy and of 
several varieties.  There are no
large streams and many of the 
small ones go dry in a dry
season.  The western part 
of the Township borders on a 
large prairie and consists
partly of Brushy Prairie
intersperesed with clumps of
aspen or other Timber of
not much value

T30NR16W

General Description
The surface of this Township as a general
thing is gently rolling.  The soil is
well adapted to the climate having 
a surface soil of Black mould 
and a sandy subsoil.  The south 
fork of Willow River runs through 
this Township in a North westerly 
course it sinks in several places
the current of this stream in some
places is scarcely perceptible there 
are several smaller streams all of 
which go dry through the summer season
The Timber in this Township is nearly
worthless being principally fire killed
Aspen & Oak except in the Eastern and
Southern tiers of sections where 
Hard wood of different varieties 
abound.  The bottoms are all
dry and good for hay.

T31NR16W

General Description
The Surface in the North West of 
the Township is hilly with some
sand stone; ponds in the low places;
and aspen timber, much burnt.  Soil is
poor 2nd & 3rd Rate; In the NE surface
nearly level with a few Sand Stone bou
=lders; Timber chiefly Pine, of an inferior
quality; South of Willow River the 
Surface is gently Rolling, Soil 2nd Rate.
Timber almost Whilly Aspen Killed 
by fire with a dense Undergrowth of 
Aspen, Hazle, Cherry, Hawthorne, Plum, & Willow.
Willow River at this dry season has 
about 2 feet of Water; current brisk and
clear, bed sand or gravel; banks sand
or Alluvion 2 to 4 feet high; Marshes
on it overflow 2 feet; Pine, Birch & Oak
are the only kinds of timber of any value.
Soil too sandy to last; there is a good
deal of hay cut for use of Lumbermen
on Willow River.
Though there is a good deal of Pine 
Timber it is so much mixed with other
growths that it could not be noted as
lying in distinct bodies, but there is more 
in the vicinity of Willow River than in
other parts of the Township and that not
of the best quality.

T32NR16W

General Description
Some parts of this Township have a 
good Second Rate Soil and very fine 
Sugar Maple and Oak Timber; and in
many places the Pine is dense and of
a good quality, but not in large bodies.
A good deal of what is termed Norway 
Pine harder than the White.
In the SW part the Timber is chiefly
Aspen much burnt and broken by the 
wind a dense undergrowth of 
Aspen, Hazle, Hawthorn, Plum Cherry & Oak.
Sand Stone rounded by attrition shows
frequently upon the surface.
Apple River is Rapid + Rocky with low
but firm sandy banks + is much used 
in running logs to Lake St. Croix.
The two Lakes meanders are beautiful
and the North one surrounded with good
timber, The swamps seem to be all of 
them wholly irreclaimable and generally
overflowing 2 feet deep in that season.

T33NR16W

General Description
The Surface in this Township 
is gently rolling except in the
vicinity of Apple River where it is hilly
in some places, particularly near the lakes,
broken.  The is is thin with a subsoil 
chiefly of sand and gravel, except in 
the pine land which has a clay subsoil.
In sections 14,15,22,23,+26 there is some
very good pine timber as also near 
the Lakes West of the Rover.  The Rest of
the Township has a mixed growth of 
Oak, Elm, Ash Maple and Linden, except
the NW portion, which has chiefly aspen
+ Pine, vry much damaged by fire.
Undergrowth hazle, Prickly Ash, hawthorne
Ironwood, Blue Beech + Pine in some
places very dense.
Apple River is almost a continuous
rice bed, with miry low banks, a current 
scarcely perceptable and a bed of deep
black muck.  Here is what the lumbermen
call the "Dead Water" in Apple River.
They have built several dams across 
it for loging purposes.
The meandered lakes have mostly
dry well defined shires of sand
gravel and Pebblestone and seem to be deep.
Much of the best Pine has been
cut and been run outh of the River, but
some sections are not touched.
The swamps are nearly all 
uncultivable as are most of the
marshes, some of the latter are
good for hay.  Some of the Cran-
-berry Marshes are valuable.

T34NR16W

General Description
There is more Pine in this Township 
than in any other in the district and there
are now three companies of Lumbermen
cutting it down, this body of Pine 
is best near Apple River and extends
a mile on Each Side the remainder
of the timber consists of Oak Elm
Ash Birch Linden and Sugar Maple.
The ground surface (excepting Balsam
Lake) gently rolling the soil
is 2nd rate, inclined to be Sandy
near Balsam Lake the surface is hilly
but the soil is a good 2nd rate.
Apple River is rapid and would
in some places afford mill sites
the bed is Rocky and the banks are in 
some places abrupt.  The swamp
lands are nearly all uncultivable.
