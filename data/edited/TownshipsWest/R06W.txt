break out near the heads of deep ravines
and run a Short distance and disappear
The hollows are principally with out timber
and they are from one to two chains in 
width Soil first rate. the heads of the
hollows are principally well timbered with 
Oak and some lynn & sugar tree. The 
ridges between the hollows are thinly timbered

is narrow and Mostly wet. Along
the South and S. Easterly side of 
the river, there is some good sugartree
Ast Lynn Elm and a few scattering

  General descripiton
	The best land in this Township is in the 
2nd bottoms (so called) on Raccoon creek, which are
elevated about 40 feet above the creek, are dry &
level, with scattering Bur Oaks & a black, sandy
soil. Other parts of this bottom are much lower
& where not marshy subject to inundation.
After leaving the bluffs on N side of creek,
the land is a high rolling ridge; in some places
well timbered & generally 2nd rate. Some of 
the long ravines which make towards the creek
are well adapted to cultivation, with timber
convienient & the purest water.
	The cliffs are generally about 250
to 300 feet high, terminating towards Raccoon
Creek in pricipices of Sandstone, in almost
every picturesque form imaginable.
	Along the sides of the steepest hills
may be found many curious silicious and 
caleareous formations, but no appearances of 
any thing more valuable.

	General description
	The Creek which passes nearly through the 
centre of this Township & its valley, are termed the
"Mormon Coulit" from a settlement of that sect
first made just west of this Township, and since
abandoned by them.  The bottoms on it are wet
except near the foot of the hills where there is 
some first rate soil, generally with a sparse
growth of Bur Oaks. As on other streams in 
this region the hills are very high & steep_ say,
250 feet_terminating, towards Mormon Creek
in bare sandstone cliffs or quarries, with a few
Birch & Bur Oak trees. In some of the swamps
there is a thick growth of Tamarac or Juniper.
The ridges are in many places gently rolling,
with a fine growth of Black & White Oak,
and a good 2nd rate soil, well adapted to tillage
but between these high ridges & the bottoms the 
surface is very broken; in some places rocky,
& may be termed 3rd rate, both in soil & timber
A great many trout in spring branches.
