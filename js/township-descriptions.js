The face of the Country\nin the east side is level and open, towards\nthe Fox River; on the west side, it is hilly.\n\tThe climate is healthful, and much\nof the soil good.

It is a warm, willing soil, but one\nthat will need moderation in corn and\nwheat-cropping, and care and skill in\nhusbanding its natural resources, in order \nto make it permanently useful to the agricul=\n=turist. And this remark is especially applica=\n=ble to the whole of this Indian tract of coun=\n=try; that is, the cultivable portions of it. In the\ntown now under condideration, there is a deficien=\n=cy in streams of living water, Spring Lake being\nalmost the only condiderable body of water,\n\nTown 18 North, Range 11 East, 4th Meridian\nthat has an outlet. White River passes\nthrough two or three of the South west Sections\nof this township, and Willow Creek through the\nN.E part, increases as this land is near its\nbend to the East by a small brook which is the\nnatural outlet to Menominee John's Lake,\nsituated in the township next north, and which \nruns an easterly course through four or five\nof the sections in the north tier. The land\nabout Spring Lake, in the S.E. part of the\nTownship abounds in springs of pure sweet\nwater; but the character of the surface around\nit is such as to render it dangerous of approach\nto cattle and horses, as also are some of the\nmarshes north east illegible.

I have had\noccasion to remark in the course of the present\nautumn, between the first of September and\nNovember a Subsidence in waters of Hill's\nLake, to the mount of at least 2 ft. in per=\npendicular height. Within the past year, a \nnarrow ditch has been cut from the South side\nof Fish Lake to the north margin of Wolf Lake,\nat a point where the two lakes approach each other \nwithin 1 1/2 chains, since which, there has been a\nconstant flow of water from Fish into Wolf Lake,\nwithout as yet affecting an equilibrium.
